      "Hi there! I know it said something about not giving advice relating to a criminal case, but this question kind of is but not at the same time... so I'll just ask and hopefully you can help! Not knowing is the only thing keeping us from going to court. I was curious if you have a case (criminal) that was never resolved in another state from ###, will that have an impact on a custody case if the other parent tries to use it against you? And can you be extradited because of it? We would love to go to court and be awarded shared custody of our girls, but the other parent is using this past thing as blackmail basically to keep us from fighting\" for our girls... which is how she got full custody to begin with because she blackmailed into signing an agreement giving her full. I hope you can help. It's been ###'ve seen our girls and we miss them terribly! Thank you so much for your time! (:### ###\"\n",
      "Hi ###,Youâ€™re right that we donâ€™t normally answer criminal questions, but this one seems to be mostly a question about getting custody.Parents who donâ€™t get along use all kinds of things from each otherâ€™s backgrounds to manipulate the situation. Itâ€™s very common.The best way to address this is to be up front with the Court about your background, and address any outstanding problems. That basically neutralizes they other sideâ€™s ammunition against you.Is there an out of state warrant? Some states extradite from ###, and some states donâ€™t. It may also depend on the severity of the crime. Some states have policies that they wonâ€™t extradite for misdemeanors. Some might not extradite if the case is old. Or some states just might not have the money for an extradition.Addressing the out of state issue and getting it resolved would solve two problems. First, your ex would no longer have any ammunition to use to manipulate you. And second, it would show the Judge that you take Court orders seriously and are a responsible person. Running from this issue never makes things any better. Is it really worth not having access to your child to stay on the run? Itâ€™s probably best to contact the out of state court and get the issue resolved. Also, if the judge asks you in court whether you voluntarily signed the agreement, you should be honest. If your ex made you sign it by blackmail, thatâ€™s something that really reflects badly on her. But the judge doesnâ€™t know she did that unless you are honest with the court. Good luck. \n",
      "Hi ###,What is your question?  It sounds like what is being asked of you is not unusual in a Workers Comp case.

It might be very helpful for you.  http://labor.###.gov/wc/wc-and-you.htm Good luck.  Let us know if you have any further questions. \"\n",
      "Hi ###,I'm happy to help you figure out which forms to use.  It sounds like to me that you had a child while married to ###, but ### is not the father.  You have the Three-Way Affidavit of Paternity signed by all parties (you, ###, and the biological father), and you all agree ### is not the father.  So now you have to figure out: do you want a Dissolution or a Divorce?  SHC-PAC9A & SHC-PAC9B are for divorce.  DR-###. The difference between a divorce and a dissolution is whether you and ### agree 100% on all issues. If you agree on everything, then a dissolution (DR-3) can be easier.  You both write down your agreement, and both sign it, and file it together.  You two work together as a team to ask the judge to approve your agreement.  Normally you both appear together, but he can appear telephonically from jail if he wants to arrange that.  If the judge approves the agreement, then she declares the two of you no longer married.  If there is anything that you and ### disagree on, like any value of any marital property, or whether one of you has something that belongs to the other, then do the divorce instead of the dissolution.  The divorce packets are SHC-PAC9A and SHC-PAC9B. Check out the instructions under SHC-PCA9A.  http://courts.alaska.gov/shc/family/shcforms.htm#shc-pac9a It has a packet for Uncontested Divorce with a born child (your son), no shared children, and no marital property.

      "Hi ###,I see that you are asking about what you can do to get your kids back, now that ### is in your life.The easiest and quickest way to get your kids back is to comply with ###'s safety plan. ### can really be a pain, and sometimes working with them can be really difficult.  But unfortunately they are in charge now.  The goal of the ### agency is to reunify children with parents.  However, they want to make sure the parents are making good choices, and dealing with any problems in their lives that can be unsafe for the kids.So you have to go by their safety plan and make sure that your place is safe for the kids.  That includes getting clean & sober yourself.  If your boyfriend isn't safe around the kids, then you need to put your kids first.  ### wants to see that the safety of your kids is a priority for you.  Otherwise, it will keep your kids with other people who they find that will put them first. The other option is to fight ###.  Unfortunately, that can make it more difficult to get your kids back.  Complying really is the quickest way.  You need to show them that you can be trusted to follow the law and their rules.  I know this probably isn't what you wanted to hear.  There's really no easy way around it.  Good luck. \n",

      "Okay, I understand. Thank you for taking the time to help answer my questions. I greatly appreciate it.\n",
      "The court has already set date and time for the pretrial scheduling conference (### at ###).  You don't need to do anything about the date/time unless the date/time that the court picked is inconvenient for you, in which case there's a process for asking for permission to attend by telephone (if you're available but can't be at the courthouse) or for asking the court to move the event to a different date/time (if you're not available at all).  The ### thing is a different issue.   In a lawsuit, the court rules (specifically, Civil Rule 26) say that the parties/attorneys should talk about exchanging information, scheduling of case events, etc., and make a plan for how the case will proceed.  Things that get discussed include:what trial dates would be convenient for each side (the judge will make the final decision about a trial date, but most judges ask the parties for their preferences and take into account things like availability of key witnesses)whether either side wants to take depositions (in-person witness interviews in front of a court reporter)whether either side wants to use a lot of formal discovery (information-gathering)In most cases like yours, the court issues a routine order, like the one you got, directing the parties (a) to have that discussion at least ###, and (b) to file a written report at least ###.The specifics of what a judge expects the parties to do vary from judge to judge.   I can't tell you anything about the habits of the judge assigned to your case since I don't have any experience with her.   But, most judges don't expect either side to put a lot of time and effort and money into a case that involves a ### for less than $10,000.   So, even though the court rules say that you're supposed to do a lot of things, in reality most of those things get ignored in cases like yours since no one wants to run up a big ### for attorney fees for case preparation.  (I'm not advising you to ignore court rules or court orders -- I'm just ### that parties and attorneys often don't follow the letter of the rules in cases this size because the dollar amount at issue doesn't warrant all that work.)So what should you do?   Send NDR a copy of the order you got and ask them to fix this by, say, the end of July.  If it's not fixed by then, contact AmEx's attorney, if he hasn't already gotten in touch with you, about exchanging information, selecting a trial date, and developing a plan for the case.   \n",

      "Hi ###,I understand you want to change your son's last name to your last name. The thing to know about changing a child's last name is that it is for appearances only.  It does not legally change in any way who the child's father is or if the child is connected to his father legally.  It does not give you any more custodial rights as his mother or remove his father from his birth certificate or keep your ex from seeking custody of your son or anything else.  Literally nothing changes except for show.  If your ex has not made any effort to be part of your son's life, I strongly recommend you file for primary custody.  You will have to serve your son's father, or make significant efforts to serve him with the court paperwork.  But once you do that, and he has a chance to be involved in the court case, then you are in a much stronger position.  In the cases that I have seen, if the other parent has made no effort to support the child or spend time with him, then the court easily grants custody to the loving parent.  It's almost a no-brainer.  But the judge has to at least give your ex a chance to say his piece.  Once he does, and the judge grants you custody, you're on very solid legal footing.  I'd recommend getting custody squared away before filing for the name change.  If you have sole legal custody, then changing your son's name isn't difficult.  If you don't have judge-approved legal custody though, it will be harder to change your son's name unless his father gives consent.  Here is some information on filing for a name change.  http://courts.alaska.gov/shc/family/shcname.htm If your ex does not want his son's name changed, the court would have to find some good reason to go against his wishes.  Your ex is still legally your child's father, so he would still get a say in the name of the child.  Again, I recommend getting primary custody and sole legal custody of your son before you seek the name change.  It would put your position on much more solid legal footing.  You can find out how to file for custody here.  http://courts.alaska.gov/shc/family/shccustody.htm Watch the videos.  Call the Family Law Self-Help Center at ###-### if you need help filling out the forms.  Let me know if you have any further questions.  Good luck. \n",

Their closest office is in Juneau, but they help folks all over the state.  Here's the website of a lawyer in Sitka.  She may be able to help.  http://www.sitkalegal.com/affordable-legal-services.html Check out the Family Law Self-Help Center.  It's a website and phone hotline that can help you start a legal case.  http://courts.###.gov/shc/family/selfhelp.htm If I were you, I'd file for child custody, and possibly for divorce.  If you file for child custody, you may get a court order to make her return the children.  The other thing is to make sure you are taking your own meds and staying on top of your own mental or physical health treatment. You can't fight this fight without being healthy yourself.  Good luck.  \n",
      "Dear Mr. ###,I would like to refer you to the state court's housing website if you have not seen it already:  http://courts.alaska.gov/shc/housing.htm.The materials are very good, including the forms you might need.  I think if you look through them you will see what you need to do.  Basically, you may repair and deduct the costs but you must be sure to follow the process set forth in the statute.  If that does not and if the landlord has breached the lease and/or caused you damages, the you may sue the landlord to recover.I hope this helps.  Best wishes to you.\n",
      "I have a couple questions based upon your question. First you state the judge granted his motion for expidited and granted no visitation until the hearing. Is there a hearing date set? Second when the judge made his order to he provide a to do list of what needed to occur in order for you to gain visitation with the children? Finally, did the judge send the case to a custody investigator or something to that degree? Someone that will speak with the kids. Also what was the custody arrangement when your ex filed for the modification? What ages are the children?\n",
      "Okay for the hearing concerning his motion to modify the agreement you need to have witnesses who can testify to the fact that you are a good sober parent and that you do not abuse the children. Was there a report from the custody investigator that spoke to your kids? Were they hired by your ex to talk to the kids? A court appointed one will not talk to the kids until appointed by the court which does not occur until you have been before the court on your case. \n",
      "Should I have my witnesses write letters for me? I got a court date it is ###th. I am supposed to fax over Trial Briefs which I do not really know what are, by ###st. The custody investigator was hired by my ex. What should I turn in for the trial briefs? What can I exspect from this hearing on ###th? I am so nervouse becuuse while I am truly a good parent and none of what is being said is true. He has a lawyer and I do not. I have no idea what I am supposed to be doing. Or what comes next.\n",
      "The trial brief is supposed to be your synopisis of the case. The facts from your point of view and what you will be providing at trial. It is better if you can have your witnesses available to testify because in most cases the court will not accept letters as they are considered hearsay becasue they cannot be crossexamined. It states this will be a formal trial so he will be presenting evidence to support his side of the story in order to have the court grant him custody. You need to have your witnesses available to testify that can show that his information is not the full story. What did the custody investigator he hired say? Did they write a report or anything? \n",
      "Hi ###,I can see from CourtView that you were served back in ###. It's now September. In divorce and custody cases, it is not unusual for people to be scared as to what is going to happen, so they just put the documents away and hope the issue disappears.  Unfortunately, that doesn't happen.  Cases like this do not go away.  I don't know what's been happening in your life since ###.  But the judge will want to hear why you haven't responded to anything in this case.  If you don't respond, the judge will probably rule against you.  At the very least, the judge will want to hear how busy you've been and why this hasn't been a priority for you.  If you've been calling lawyers asking for help, make a list of the ones you've called so you can show that you've at least been working on trying to find a lawyer. I'd suggest reaching out to your local Legal Services office.  https://www.alsc-law.org/contact-us/ Here are some videos that can help you figure out what to do in your family law case: http://courts.alaska.gov/shc/family/shcabout.htm#videos You might also find a lawyer that provides Unbundled Legal Services.

      "Hi ###,Thanks for the follow up questions. It sounds like you've really been working on your Answer.  Yes, both your and your husband should file separate responses, even if they are exactly the same.  It is legal to group paragraphs together, but I think it's more precise if you answer each number with a number of your own.  So like 26) Deny, 27) Admit, 28) Deny, etc. I can see where the plaintiffs notarized the Complaint, they wrote a different title.  It seems to be a title was changed at some point and they didn't change it everywhere.  Frankly, I don't think this is something that the court would kick it out for, but I don't see a harm in mentioning it if you want.  Good luck.  Let me know if I can be of further help. \n",
      "Thank you so much for your feedback. I will make the necessary modifications and we will be filing the responses on Thursday. At this time we are going to be representing ourselves, but will likely be seeking out legal counsel in the future as the case moves forward. Sincerely, ###\n",

      "Hi ###,I understand you want some help figuring out how the judge decided to have your mom be guardian of your son.  I can see in CourtView, the court's computer system, that your mom filed for Guardianship at the Ketchikan Courthouse in ###17.  The case number is ###.  It looks like the court attempted to send something to you in ######, but they didn't have a good address and the mail was returned. The court held some hearings in January and February and the judge issued his order after those hearings.  Since guardianships often involve very personal issues, they are generally kept confidential from the public.  That means I can't see much about it.  I would suggest you call the Ketchikan Court at 1-800-###.  http://courts.alaska.gov/courtdir/1ke.htm If it's easy for you to get there, you could also go to the courthouse in person and ask what happened in court.  They can help you understand what happened.  Make sure you take your case number, ###.  The court can give you copies of the court paperwork so you know what your mom can and cannot do as guardian.  If you missed court, the judge will need a very good reason why you missed it.Feel free to ask any follow-up questions you have. \n",

Have you made a report to ### or the Police or taken your daughter to the hospital to be examined following her statements to you. Was there anyone else who was present that also heard what she said? You will be asked by the judge to give testimony and present any witnesses that you have as to why the order should be granted.

You will then also be given the chance to ask him questions and the judge can ask questions of either party or witnesses as well. If there are any medical records showing the molestation or if she was examined by a nurse or a report made to police you should bring those papers and ask those individuals to be witnesses. If you are uncomfortable being in the same room with him bring a friend to be your moral support. How old is your daughter?

      "First off my sister that is ###, so I made sure to get the guardianship forms for that. And originally both of our parents signed the agreement papers to appoint me her guardian. Now they are saying no, but I still want to move forward because she is most safe and in a stable environment with me. My question is, can I turn in the packet without the parent consent papers? Or is there a whole other packet I need to do?\n",
      "My oldest sons, ### (15) and Miles (14), have been living with my ex-husband ### Apple (not their natural father) in ### since ###17. Before that, they were living in Oklahoma. They have been with ### since ###16, when he agreed to take them in as we were facing homelessness to flee from my fatherâ€™s threatening behavior in ###, where we had been staying after being in a similar situation with my mother months before, in ###.In ###17, ### asked me to sign forms for a temporary guardianship which he filed with the Oklahoma City Court. I was not able to appear at the hearing because I was living in ### and  I was not expecting that our mutual agreement would come with mandates from the judge, who laid out in detail requirements that I should satisfy before filing a petition to terminate the temporary guardianship. I have met all but one of the requirements, though not simultaneously; ###, ###, ###. The final and unfinished requirement is submitting a hair follicle and urine analysis drug screening, which I waited on until I figured out what steps to take after completing the timelines as ordered.After getting started with self-help legal research, I discovered that Colorado is the home state for my sons per the Uniform Child Custody Jurisdiction Enforcement Act. Despite my efforts and the facts of the ###, ### is not in mutual agreement with me about returning my sons to live with me right away and insists that I go through further legal processes. I suspect he may be acting in retaliation to our separation and divorce, which I initiated (###), and the newest addition to my family; another son, born in July of 2017. Thinking back, it was not long after telling ### that I was pregnant that he suggested the guardianship.After further research and consult with a ### area attorney, I have concluded that ### may have jurisdiction after all because of a custody order from ### in ###. FYI, their natural father has not been a presence in their lives since 2007. It has been suggested that it may be possible for me to take a certified copy of the custody order from ### to my ex-husband in ### using a civil assist from the ### Police Department to get my sons and bring them back home. ### and Miles are waiting very patiently and ### of word on when they can return to be with me, and finally meet their little brother ###.Finally, my questions; Does ### have jurisdiction per the original custody order? If so, can I just fly down there with its certified copy in hand and get my boys on the next plane back? What are the possibilities?\n",
      "Hi ###,I see that your question has to do with which state has jurisdiction over the custody of your sons Miles and ###.  You can not just fly down to Colorado and pick up your sons.  It doesn't work that way.  The UCCJEA is exactly the right place to start with figuring this out.  Normally under the UCCJEA, the state with jurisdiction would be where the children have lived for the last ###.  That would be Colorado.  However, the main exception to the UCCJEA is if another state has previously dealt with the boys' case.  In your case, it sounds like they were the subject of a custody order in ### in ### 2017.  The question you need to figure out is which of these states would be the best for you.  (Colorado, Oklahoma, or ###) Which one of these states would you prefer?  You could make an argument that any of these states have jurisdiction.  Each state has different laws when it comes to custody.  Where are the laws better for you?  In ###, for instance, substance abuse is something the judges consider strongly in awarding primary custody.  If you have mental health or substance abuse issues, perhaps it would be to your advantage for the Colorado or Oklahoma court to consider your case. Once you figure out which state would be more advantageous for your case, you file a motion in the other state to transfer jurisdiction to the state you want.  For example, if you thought Colorado would be the most favorable for you, you'd file a motion in the Oklahoma case saying jurisdiction should be transferred to Colorado.  If that ###, you'd file a motion in the Colorado court asking that you be given primary custody of the kids.  If you think ### is the best jurisdiction for you, you'd have to file a motion in the Colorado court and ask that the case be transferred to ###, and then ask an ### judge for primary custody.  You can never ever just go to another state and pick up your kids without the other parent's approval.  You need to get a judge's permission.  In your situation, you need to pick the right judge.  Additionally, it may be helpful to ask your ex to let you have time to visit the boys in Colorado.  Regardless of their legal status, ### the kids from their friends and school in Colorado would be traumatic.  Try to visit them there and see what their daily lives are like before thinking of moving them.  After all, this is about what is best for them, not for you or even your new baby. \n",
      "Thank you for your reply. I know that my sons would not suffer trauma as a result. They want to be with me, here in ###. They are not happy living with my ex husband, who is not their natural father nor has he adopted them. Them going to stay with him was an extreme measure as proven by his now apparent lack of compassion for the continued effort I put in as a mother.My only concerns have been communication and logistics in getting the matter sorted. It is because of that our situation became complicated in the Oklahoma court system as they did not make accommodations for me to be included in the hearing telephonically. What was to be a mutual benefit and agreement became ### because due to geographical disadvantage, and my sons and I suffer because of it. I want to address this as ### as possible. The best venue for that would be where I am, here in ###.I have sole custody ### from ###. If ### already has jurisdiction why would I be filing in another state to transfer jurisdiction to where it originates? What sort of custody is it that I would request the courts in Colorado to transfer to ### if the only order of custody is from ###? Does it have to do with the UCCJEA designating Colorado as the home state yet also identifies ### as having jurisdiction because of the custody order already in place?\n",
      "Youâ€™re asking for my advice. If you want the ### court to be the one with jurisdiction, youâ€™d need to file something in the other courts asking them to consider ### to have jurisdiction. Thatâ€™s the cleanest and most effective way to do it. I wouldnâ€™t advise you to just assume ### has jurisdiction. Iâ€™d advise getting a Colorado judge to agree with you. Then youâ€™d be on much stronger legal footing. \n",

It's just a huge mess. Even the umv worker the same one that handed my sister her title a few weeks ago cant believe how this happened.

      "A judgment doesn't necessarily prevent a person from buying a house.   In your case, it's quite possible that the lender did not know about the judgment because (a) you didn't know about it and therefore didn't disclose it, (b) the judgment was issued in Texas, not ###, and (c) the credit card account may have been old enough to have dropped off your credit report.  You don't have to have a lawyer, but it in a situation like yours, a little lawyering can sometimes help a lot.   In Anchorage, ### (###) ### handles a lot of ### defense matters.   If you'd like to talk with an attorney who also handles bankruptcies in case you decide to file, your choices include ### ###, ### ###, ### ###, and ### ###.  If you're going to get help from a lawyer, do that before you make contact with the firm that wrote to you about the judgment.  \n",

      "Thanks for the extra information.  Yes, definitely listen to the recording of the proceeding.  A lot depends on whether the judge went over this particular part of the agreement with you.  Even if the judge did, and you said yes, you could still file.  There is not really any downside to filing a Motion to Modify the property division.  It might not be successful, but not every motion is.  You may have to pay a filing fee.  I'd call it a Motion for Relief from Judgment, and file it under Civil Rule 60(b).  Generally property division orders can't be modified after they are put in place, but 60(b) allows them to be changed for several reasons.  Look over that rule and figure out which of the options fits your case best.  Put in your motion which reason you think might fit.  There are no forms available for a 60(b) motion specifically, but here is some help for filing a motion.  ### Like I said, I think the success of winning is probably 50-###, but you may as well give it a try.  There's not a huge downside, and there's a big upside if you win.  Here are the Alaska Civil Rules.

      "I have a ###. I recently found out that his father has been really gaslighting me for the past year and actually got married ###. Weâ€™ve had a paternity test and heâ€™s had the results for around one month and he has continued to ignore his son. He refuses to communicate with me and I firmly believe that ###â€™s family isnâ€™t even aware that he exists. I would like to take his dad to small claims and sue for the information for ###â€™s grandparents. If I did that and he didnâ€™t respond, like I assume he wonâ€™t, what would be appropriate to ask for? Would I ask for a dollar amount for a private investigator or simply ask for him to be responsible for the final ###? I realize that I could do an Internet search for cheaper but I really am having extreme anxiety about the whole ordeal and would prefer to work with someone directly who can represent ### with some dignity. Also, I donâ€™t even know if it sounds like a viable case anyway. I also donâ€™t have anything other than a phone number and the address of the house he lived in last year, I have no knowledge if he has moved or not. \n",
      "Hi ###,It sounds like you want to get in touch with your son's father.  If he doesn't want to be in touch with you, unfortunately it is not required. You can't make him be a part of your life or your son's life.  There's also nothing in the law that says you're entitled to contact information for your son's Grandparents.  They are allowed to stay away from you.  I would advise against hiring an investigator or trying to track them down. You're also not legally entitled to be informed when your son's father gets married.  That was pretty rude of him not to tell you, but he doesn't have to involve you when he decides to get married to someone else.  You are, however, entitled to child support.  You can apply for child support from your son's father through the ### Child Support Services Division website.  http://childsupport.###.gov/ Here is a video on how to apply for child support.  http://childsupport.###.gov/ApplyForServicesTutorialWeb/ Once the state government orders child support to be paid, it can be withdrawn from his paycheck and deposited in your account and there's no requirement that you two communicate with each other.  In addition, it sounds like your son's father is not interested in being in your son's life.  If that is the case, you may want to apply for custody so that you have a legal document making you your son's primary parent.

      "Iâ€™m not confused about what the law is, I understand that there is not a law or traditional channel to go through to receive the information of who the my sons family is, because if there was I would be doing it. Iâ€™m not confused on what the procedures are. So my follow up question is WHY, what law states that ### has the right to ### me and then leave the entire responsibility of the child to me and my family. I tried to talk about adoption with him, but he didnâ€™t want to. I donâ€™t want to force anyone to have a relationship with him, but they should know he exists, and that any family would be loved by him. Why is that wrong? I did not try and force ### to bond with my belly, I did not plan his birth with ###, but ### is here, he is ###, and Iâ€™ve waited a month past the time of receiving the paternity test results, which were not needed by me. Iâ€™ve been too respectful of his right to privacy but my son deserves to know his family, not be put off to the side until if or when some random I dated for two months decide. I was also wanting to do small claims because if he answered, which I doubt the ### would, with some valid point like â€œmy mom belongs to an ### and would not be okay with thisâ€ or â€œmy dad is deadâ€. if you canâ€™t tell, ### do it. Iâ€™ll keep you updated with what happens. \n",
      "Hi ###,Thanks for your follow-up. I think I might finally understand. I appreciate your patience.It sounds like you want to bring legal action to help your son get to know his grandparents. Unfortunately, I donâ€™t know of anything in the law that would help you with this. There is nothing in the law that requires a child to know his grandparents, or even his father. If ### parents donâ€™t want to be involved with their ### life, thatâ€™s up to them. The judge wonâ€™t force them. The law only requires a father to pay child support to support his child. It sounds like youâ€™re on top of that. The reason I advised against finding them and contacting them is because I think there may be a risk of alienating them further.

I submitted a very detailed opposition citing case law, etc. that there is no significant change in circumstances and it is not in the best interest of our son since I already allow him to visit whenever he wants to (with ###).  I had asked for an extension so the judge received my opposition only a week before our scheduling conference.  I was hoping he would dismiss the case, but I don't think he read my opposition because he scheduled an evidentiary hearing in January.  I live in ### and will have to travel to ### for the hearing.  Is there anything I can do to get the judge to read my opposition prior to the hearing?  Would submitting a motion to dismiss or a request for summary judgement help the judge make a decision before the hearing?Thank you for your time.Sincerely,### L Matter###-###  \n",

      "I'm an Alaskan citizen who goes to school in New Hampshire. Last year, I was sexually assaulted on my campus by two other students on two separate occasions. I've told many of my friends about it over the years and in return they have told me their ### stories. We often report it, but our school is infamous for not investigating sexual assault reports. In fact, the college is being sued for that right now. We've all tried to remember the names of the people who have assaulted us so that we can avoid hooking up with them, drinking with them, or anything else that could make them potentially dangerous (especially since sometimes it's the same assaulter again and again), but there are too many too keep track of. So I made a google doc where anyone with the link could put the names of people who assaulted them, the assault story, if the person is affiliated with a Greek house, if there were any actions taken on the assault (reporting, etc.), and if the student is still on campus. I sent it to a lot of friends who also sent it to others and it quickly spread all over campus. It turned into an over three page document, but Greek houses began putting out ### to not add to the document in case of legal repercussions and the document quickly ### to one page. I've had several people ask me if I know who made the document, telling me that there could be legal repercussions. I've since changed the settings on the doc so that people with the link can't see or edit it. I'd like to keep the document alive so that we can use it to keep save, but I don't know if I actually could face legal repercussions like a defamation or libel suit. I also don't know if I'm at risk of a suit or other legal repercussions with where I am at now, having been the person who made the doc and added two stories to it, even though the doc is not currently open to anyone but me.As for the two stories I put on the doc - one of them I reported to Title IX a year after the event and they informed me that the individual had graduated but was banned from campus because of their findings on other reports. The other student I put up I have not reported and as far as I know they have faced no legal repercussions. The only thing I have to prove that that story isn't false is my friends who heard me talk about it and some screenshots of a conversation with him where he admits to some of the things I wrote about.I need to know if I could be successfully sued for defamation or libel because of the experiences I put on the ### creating the doc, or if I could face any other legal repercussions because of it.\n",

      "I need to write a will.  I have one adult daughter.  And I have one adult son, who is considered incapacitated by the court.  I am his court appointed legal guardian.  He currently gets services through ### waiver (###: ###, day habilitation and supported living.) His medical insurance is through ### Care.  And he gets SSI and Adult public assistance.  He lives in my home as a renter.  I do not want to leave anything to him in my will as I do not wish for this to impact his benefits through the waiver, SSI and public assistance.  I didn't want to have to set up a living trust for him.  I do have a co-guardian in case something were to happen to me.  I would also outline in will who I would nominate to be guardian if both co-guardians were to die.I have a number of life insurance policies which the beneficiaries are other family members (including my daughter).  I have savings account and checking accounts with balances.  And I have a small 401K, ### stock, as well as I own a small amount of Class A stock in the company that I work for.  The 401K has beneficiaries set up and so do the ###.  So I would have to designate who would get the value of the Class A stock in the will (which would be my daughter). So really the rest of what I have is bank accounts and personal belongings, including my older vehicle. I would designate who these go to, not my son.Can I legally disinherit my disabled son so that it will not affect his benefits, what exactly must be included in the will to do that other than a statement such as:  I am not unmindful of my son, ### ### Gray, but it is my intention that he receive nothing pursuant to this Will, and is there anyone who can help draft this section of the will, or the will in its entirety without a large cost?  I have attached the draft of the will I am currently working on.\n",
      "Hi, ### --Yes, you may disinherit your disabled adult son.   Yes, the language in your draft will is adequate to disinherit him, assuming the will is properly signed and witnessed.Whether it's a good idea to disinherit your disabled adult son is a different question.   Please allow me to comment about that even though you didn't ask that question:You are absolutely right that it's not a good idea to leave an unrestricted inheritance to a disabled adult son who receives public assistance benefits.   That's because, as you're aware, the inheritance may disqualify your son for benefits until he spends down the inheritance (often for items that benefits had previously paid for, like health care and housing)  and has so little left that he again meets the ### requirements to qualify for benefits.But, it's possible to leave an inheritance for your son in a way that it doesn't disqualify him for benefits.   The inheritance can then be used for stuff that benefits won't cover yet might make his life ### -- things like a ### vehicle; movies; vacations (including companion travel); ### health care services; a new computer and ### and fast internet; a pet (and veterinary care); and lots of other things.  The trick to giving him an inheritance is that you don't give it to him outright.    You  leave it under someone else's care in a way that he can't control it (usually in a trust, either established by your will or established during your lifetime), with instructions to use the money for things that public assistance benefits don't pay for.   (The language is slightly more technical than that, but that's the general idea.)   Your note indicates that you don't want to set up a living trust, but the information you provided indicates that a living trust is probably the right tool for passing your wealth after you die.   Even if you didn't have a disabled adult son, you'd still want to consider that, at the time you die, the money you leave in your bank accounts, investment accounts, and life insurance policies might pass to someone who shouldn't receive an outright inheritance, either because that person is then getting public assistance benefits (even if they're not on benefits right now), or would waste the inheritance (for example, on drugs, even if they don't have a substance abuse problem right now), or is a minor who would get the entire inheritance when turning age ### (an age at which many people aren't capable of managing much money responsibly).  A living trust would also enable your family to avoid probating your estate (because you'd transfer your home and other probate assets into the trust).   Setting up a living trust usually costs a lot less than the average probate case in court.   A living trust also usually allows your ### to administer your estate much faster than a probate case.A living trust also lets someone else manage your finances, without having to go to court for a guardianship or conservatorship, if you become incapacitated.There are lots of attorneys in the Anchorage area who handle living trusts (and estate planning generally).   Some include:### ###### ###### ###  (pr. ### ###)Yes, it'll cost some money to have a lawyer help you set up a living trust (and other ### paperwork).  But, the money's going to get spent sometime -- either now, by you, or by your loved ones after you're dead.  The biggest favor you can do for your loved ones is to tidy up your affairs yourself now instead of sticking them with that job after you're gone.  ### ### (### attorney)\n",
      "I do understand what you are saying about a Living Trust.  That could also potentially be good for my adult daughter, as well.  You mentioned expenses for probate costs.  I understand that there is an informal probate option, where no one contests the will, nor the executor.  Would that be a less expensive option?  Also what about the exempt property that a child has the right to receive (up to $10K).  Would my notation in will handle that too?Unfortunately, when I called about setting up living trusts, many attorneys wanted over $###.  Do you know anyone else who might handle it for less?  I can start making calls too.\n",
      "Hi there, ###. Thanks for your question. Iâ€™m sorry to hear about your predicament.The short answer is that yes, you should probably move out of the house. I understand you want to keep the house, and from a negotiating standpoint sometimes itâ€™s easier to leverage keeping something if youâ€™ve already got it. (â€œPossession is nine-tenths of the law,â€ is the phrase thatâ€™s often used.) There is some truth to that. But in your specific case, it sounds like thatâ€™s an unwise course and that there are smarter things you can do.You asked whether you can negotiate the terms of ### instance, keeping the house and child support, but not alimony or retirement funds. The answer to that is yes, with an ###: you and your husband can negotiate all kinds of different terms for separation, as long as they are things that belong to each of ### child support canâ€™t be part of that negotiation, because child support doesnâ€™t belong to you, it belongs to the children. A court will probably accept an agreement that says, â€œ### gets the house, and ### gets the retirement accounts, because thatâ€™s what ### and ### have agreed ### if you try to include the child support in that deal, then the court will probably reject your deal, because thatâ€™s a separate issue that is controlled by a different legal principle (which youâ€™ve heard a million times): â€œthe best interests of the child.â€Iâ€™ve worked with plenty of divorcing couples where things turned messy, like the situation youâ€™re describing. Iâ€™ll give you a tip right now: the first thing the judge will care about, and the thing the judge will care most about (by far!) is whatâ€™s happening with your kids. No matter how amicable your divorce is, itâ€™ll need to go before a judge at some point, and the judge is going to focus immediately on your kids. You want to be able to say, â€œYour Honor, I recognized that the dynamic in the household had become tense, so I removed the children for their own well-being.â€ You do NOT want to be in a position where the judge is asking you, â€œWhy the heck did you leave the kids in this environment?!!â€When people are divorcing, things get contentious. This is true under any circumstances, but youâ€™re describing a circumstance thatâ€™s even more problematic because of your living situation: your new partner is in the house, and your husbandâ€™s new partner is in the house. No judge is going to like hearing that. This has nothing to do with ### or anything like that; itâ€™s about creating an environment where adults are fighting and exhibiting tense and toxic emotions, and then forcing small children to live in that emotionally unstable and emotionally unsafe environment. No judge will like that. And when a ### judge dislikes what youâ€™re doing with your children, then your case doesnâ€™t go as well as youâ€™d want.So yes, I think you should find another home for the time ### the kidsâ€™ sake, and separately because thatâ€™s what a judge will want to see that youâ€™ve done. You can negotiate for the house later. If your husband refuses to negotiate, then itâ€™s possible you might be able to win the house later. But for the immediate future, do yourself a favor and make yourself look like the good mother by creating a safe space for your kids.I hope thatâ€™s helpful, ###. Remember: a large part of family law is about ### before you say or do anything, and thinking to yourself, â€œA judge will probably hear that I did this, or read this email or text message, or find out about whatever Iâ€™m about to do. How will it look to the judge, when that happens?â€ Imagine that someone is always looking over your ### thatâ€™s basically true.Good luck, ###.\n",

      "My ex-husband and I have a child custody arrangement that does not have specifics and is suppose to be equal shared 50/50. Is it hard for the mother to go back to court to become soul custody provider? given father certain times during the week (visitation) but giving mother the option to move out of the current town with children? Should I got to court for full physical custody or just for an option of moving? I would initially like week on week off but that obviously wont work once I leave town.

      "My two toddlers (now ### ###) and I moved to ### last year. Originally, their father was supposed to spend the year tying up loose ends in ###, then join us. However, ### through this a number of issues arose, including some psychological ones that their father is currently in counseling for. In short, their father decided he wanted to remain in the US, and get divorced. ### has jurisdiction over custody, as the children have been residents here for over seven months at this point, but he wants ### to handle the case.I believe that my custody proposals put the best interests of the children first and have actually considered the children, whereas he just cares about how much he gets to see them, so the court I go through doesn't matter. However, their father explicitly stated that if I brought the children to ### to visit him and provide an argument for jurisdiction for ###, he would NOT allow them to return to ### until he was ordered by a judge to do so. Which I know could take a considerable amount of time.They live here, are covered under my insurance, receive medical and dental care here, go to school here, have their friends and extracurricular activities here, etc. But according to my understanding of the law, if he filed in ### and didn't want the children to leave, I wouldn't be able to bring the children home to ### until a judge decided on custody. What can I do to help this proceed as smoothly as possible without ### my children in this kind of limbo?In short, is there any way I can give my approval to proceed with custody through ###'s court system, while also allowing my children to maintain their current lives in ### until we have an established permanent custody arrangement? (I would be requesting primary custody, with the children going to school in ###, and spending vacations with their father.)I have been advised to just apply in ###, where I have a very high chance of being awarded sole custody. However, this is something their father would fight and draw out as long as possible, during which any kind of visitation with him would probably be very difficult, which is something I don't think is fair to the children. I would like to settle things with as little conflict as possible so we can all proceed with our lives, and want to cause as little disruption to the children's lives as possible.\n",
      "Hi there, ###. Thanks for your question.If you donâ€™t mind, Iâ€™m going to be candid. From reading your prose, it doesnâ€™t really seem like youâ€™re open to good advice on this issue. You have already been told that you should apply in ###, and in fact youâ€™ve been threatened with some very serious consequences if you give ### even an inch on this issue. (â€œIf you give me the opportunity, Iâ€™ll keep the kids and refuse to return them to you.â€) Yet youâ€™re still here asking, â€œIsnâ€™t there some way I can make this work?â€It is possible to be too optimistic, ###. Sometimes the glass is ###, ### other times, itâ€™s just empty and youâ€™re seeing water where none exists.Yes, you can consent to jurisdiction in ### if youâ€™d like. Once you do that, there are absolutely no guarantees whatsoever about what will happen with your case. I wish we lived in a world where every judge was a thoughtful, fair-minded person who had the time and capacity to give every case individualized ### we donâ€™t, and itâ€™s just as likely that a family court judge will look for every craven opportunity to avoid dealing with any kind of international jurisdiction issues (which, letâ€™s face it, are unusual and sometimes difficult).I ### with your situation. Your kidsâ€™ father is their father no matter what, and youâ€™re stuck with him, and you want to make the best of it. You donâ€™t want to make things into a ### if thereâ€™s some way you can avoid a fight, you will. Thatâ€™s the kiss of death in family law. In family law, that is exactly the attitude that costs people their kids (and costs the kids their happy childhoods). I hate family-law lawyers that turn every minor dispute into a ### battle, but in the specific circumstance youâ€™re describing, giving an inch will almost certainly result in losing much, much more.Maybe Iâ€™m wrong. Maybe if you consent to jurisdiction in ###, ### will suddenly turn around and say, â€œThanks for being reasonable. In return, Iâ€™m gonna pay you the same kindness. Letâ€™s talk about whatâ€™s fair for the kidsâ€¦â€ But (tragically) that almost never happens in these cases, and I donâ€™t see anything in your question that indicates itâ€™s likely in your case, so Iâ€™d bet against it.I believe you when you say that ### is likely to ### a custody battle in ###. Youâ€™re right, that isnâ€™t fair to the children. But letâ€™s note a couple things. First: if he does that, itâ€™s not your fault. Second: if heâ€™s the kind of person to do that, then itâ€™s silly to think ### be a totally different person if you agree to litigate in ###. Third: your responsibility to the kids isnâ€™t to make the legal aspect easy or peaceful; itâ€™s to fight for whatâ€™s in their best interests. No, do not become one of those parents who uses family court and the children to fight, fight, fight with your ### yes, sometimes fighting is appropriate if what youâ€™re fighting for is, for instance, your kidsâ€™ happy and well-established lives in ###.I wish I could tell you thereâ€™s some kind of escape ### where you can consent to ###n jurisdiction (or any other stateâ€™s) and magically make the rest of the process easy. There isnâ€™t. Our family courts arenâ€™t ### of judicial ###. If I were you, Iâ€™d get every possible kind of order and judgment from those ### ### and ### that if youâ€™re ever stuck litigating in an ###n family court, you can walk in and say, â€œThese issues have already been decided by a ### court.

Then I asked the federal courthouse down the street and no courtcase. They both led me through it online so I can see for myself. Only judges can allow it to freeze as well as be garnished. They must've tried to declined my rehabilitation of the loan due to my health based on there own agenda.... Wow! They never even tried to rehabilitate the loan.\n",
      "Hi there, ###, and thanks for your question.As a general rule, no, SSDI cannot be garnished without a court order. In fact, as a general rule, SSDI canâ€™t be garnished at all. There are some exceptions, like child support or certain kinds of tax debt. The reason for the garnishment can make a difference. But as a general rule, youâ€™re right, SSDI requires a court order for any kind of garnishment.But hereâ€™s the problem: if Iâ€™m understanding your situation, itâ€™s not accurate to say that your SSDI was garnished.

I understand the practical effect was that the garnishment took away your ### the mechanism of what happened is slightly different, and that affects the legal implications.You should reach out to whoever took your money.

In either case, you should reach out to everybody ### credit union, the collector, the creditor, ### tell them exactly how much of your SSDI income was taken by the garnishment, and tell them that itâ€™s a violation of state and federal law to take SSDI without a court order specifying that SSDI is subject to garnishment, and tell them that you want that amount immediately refunded.See what happens. If theyâ€™re smart, ### refund your money immediately. If they donâ€™t, then youâ€™ll either have to let this go, or youâ€™ll have to press further.

He says that spousal support is impossible to get in ###, and that child support would only be like a small amount, like $### (he makes a ### salary before taxes) and after promising that he would help pay rent until I got back on my feet, he took back that offer and has now been out of the house for most of March and all of ### without helping me financially at all.

What paperwork or other information has convinced you that your dad's estate should have gone to the two of you?   That's not what the will and trust say.  \n",
      "This note follows up on the item I didn't have time to address earlier today -- whether there's anything you can do about the fact that your dad's will and trust don't reflect what you understood to be his wishes.Theoretically, it's possible to break a will or a trust if the person who signed it (here, your dad) either (a) didn't have legal capacity to create a will or trust because he didn't understand what he was doing, or (b) was the victim of undue influence.   The first message you posted here says your dad had dementia.   If you could prove in court that, at the time he created the will or trust, his condition was bad enough that he lacked legal capacity to make a will or trust, the court might declare the will or trust to be invalid.  If the will and trust are invalid (and if there was no prior valid will or trust), then your dad's estate probably passes according to ### law (assuming he was still an ### resident when he died).   Under ### law, a surviving spouse (here, ###) gets the first $150,### 50% of the rest; the other 50% goes to the children from a previous marriage (or their children).   So, even if you could break the will and trust, you wouldn't get everything.Another of your messages indicates that ### badgered and isolated your dad.  It's possible that her actions amounted to undue influence, so a court might invalidate the will and trust because your dad didn't create those documents of his own free will.I'm NOT recommending that you file a lawsuit.  I don't have all the facts so don't know if you have a case.  Plus, it takes money to hire a lawyer (or a really good case to convince a lawyer to take a percentage of what you recover, if anything, instead of getting paid by the hour).  There's no guarantee that you will win.  And, the fact that ### ###.   Also, the mere passage of time makes it harder to find witnesses and information needed to prove incapacity or undue influence.Another option is to contact the Office of Elder Fraud and Assistance in Anchorage to see if they can help.   Here is a link to their website:  http://doa.###.gov/opa/oefa/\n",
      "I guess I misunderstood the Will because it states he made no provision for ### because they had agreed to keep their estates separate (because there were very few community property assets.) The distribution instruments of the trusts state she is a ### beneficiary.. I appreciate your time and effort in answering my question. You have been very kind.

(I hate trusts that bury important provisions in a mountain of ###.)It doesn't make sense to me that your dad would go to the trouble of setting up a trust to segregate his assets from hers and then put a provision in the trust saying that she gets everything.

      "You asked about getting an accounting.   One way to do that might be to file a request in the probate case.   There is a pending probate case in Anchorage for your dad's estate.

      "Hi there, ###. Thanks for posting. Iâ€™m very sorry to hear about your predicament.Unfortunately I have to start with some bad news. If you had gone to court immediately when your ex took your daughter to Wisconsin, you would almost certainly have won. Courts look at a variety of factors when deciding where to put the child, and the single biggest factor is, â€œWhere has the child been living consistently?â€ Back in 2012, it sounds like she was living with you consistently. A court would have ordered your ex to bring her back to ### if he refused, then heâ€™d have gotten in a lot of trouble. (### trouble.)But if Iâ€™m understanding you right, you didnâ€™t go to court. I understand that you feel like you tried to fix the situation. You wrote, â€œEvery year Iâ€™ve attemptedâ€ to see her. But unfortunately a court is going to ask you, â€œWhat do you mean? When you say you â€˜attemptedâ€™ to see her, what did you do? Did you just ask him, and he said no? Did you do anything else?â€ It doesnâ€™t sound like you did. Thatâ€™s unfortunate.Iâ€™m not trying to give you a hard time; Iâ€™m just telling you what you need to know about how a court is going to look at your case, today. I understand that you probably feel like youâ€™ve been fighting very hard to see your daughter for many ### from the courtâ€™s perspective, you havenâ€™t been fighting. Youâ€™re only just coming to court now, nine years later.Youâ€™ve probably heard the phrase, â€œthe best interests of the child.â€ Thatâ€™s what family courts look to. What decision would be in the childâ€™s best interests? If the child has been living with you in ###, then itâ€™s not in her best interests to suddenly uproot her to Wisconsin, so a court would almost certainly order that she be returned. But now weâ€™re nine years down the road. Sheâ€™s been living consistently with her father, and it sounds like she doesnâ€™t have much contact with you. Thatâ€™s tragic and itâ€™s ### remember, â€œbest interests of the child.â€ Is a court likely to order that she be taken away from her current life and sent to live far away with a mother sheâ€™s had little contact with? Probably not.I hate telling you that. I know itâ€™s not what you want to hear, and I know itâ€™s painful, and I know it probably feels like Iâ€™m coming down hard on you. Iâ€™m truly not. This is stuff you need to ### if youâ€™re going to make progress with your daughter, then you need to begin with a clear understanding of exactly where you are right now. If you donâ€™t understand your situation, then you canâ€™t improve it.Now letâ€™s get to the good news. I have two pieces of good news for you. The first is that youâ€™re her mother and that can never change, and parents will always have rights. Even if you were completely absent for nine years and made no effort whatsoever to see your ### you wanted to come back into her life, a court would probably let you. It would have to happen in small steps, starting with things like maybe letters or FaceTime chats and then short supervised visits. But it would happen. As her mother, youâ€™ve got rights, and you can go to court to have them enforced.The second bit of good news is that you are apparently married to the father. Thatâ€™s great. Itâ€™s much easier to get courts to intervene in these situations if youâ€™re married, than if you are unmarried parents who never involved the legal system in their relationship in any way.Youâ€™ll need to decide where you want to file for divorce. Thatâ€™s up to you, but I can tell you that usually when divorcing spouses are living in different states, they each rush to file ### the person living in New York doesnâ€™t want to have to travel to Indiana for court, and vice versa. If youâ€™ve been living in ### consistently and ### is convenient for you, then you should file there.I canâ€™t promise the case will stay in ###. If you were married in ### and your husband has been living in Wisconsin, and if heâ€™s smart, then he wonâ€™t even bother coming to ###. ### file in Wisconsin and then try to get your ### case dismissed. He will argue that ### doesnâ€™t have sufficient interest in the case because the marriage happened in ###, you never lived together as a couple in ###, he lives in Wisconsin, and the child lives in Wisconsin. Thatâ€™s a good argument, and if he makes it ### if he hires a good ### ### probably prevail and the case will be dismissed in ### and youâ€™ll have to get divorced in Wisconsin. But just because you might lose that particular fight doesnâ€™t mean you shouldnâ€™t try. Again, if youâ€™ve been living in ### and thatâ€™s convenient for you, then Iâ€™d file immediately.The clerkâ€™s office at the courthouse can help you with the paperwork. They canâ€™t give you legal advice (â€œWhat should I do?â€) but they can give you information (â€œHow do I do this?â€). Tell them youâ€™re indigent (low income) and that you want to ask to have the filing fees waived. They will explain to you that once your case has been filed, youâ€™ll need to â€œserve processâ€ on your ###, you need to follow certain steps to make sure he knows about the divorce filing and has a chance to respond.Thatâ€™s the best route for you to begin exercising your parental rights. I recommend you do that immediately. Be realistic about what you ask the court to do. The court isnâ€™t likely to order that the kid immediately be sent to live with you. Thatâ€™s just not going to happen. (Unless thereâ€™s some other element that you didnâ€™t mention. Like for instance, if the father were abusive, then of course the child would be sent to live with the mother.) Be realistic about what youâ€™re asking for, and the court will take you more seriously and be more willing to work with you.Finally, give some thought to how youâ€™re going to talk about this with your daughter someday. Again, I donâ€™t mean to come down on ### you made a mistake by not fighting to see her earlier, and youâ€™re going to have to explain that to her. Itâ€™s not the end of the world. Every parent makes mistakes, and most parents make huge mistakes, and every kid has to learn to forgive the parentsâ€™ mistakes. Thatâ€™s just part of life. You should start thinking now about how youâ€™ll have those conversations with her. S### need to understand that you didnâ€™t realize you could have done more. You didnâ€™t feel like you could. But when ###, you changed as a person and realized that you had more power, and you decided to use that power to get your daughter back into your life.I hope thatâ€™s helpful, ###. Good luck. You have a long road ahead and itâ€™s going to be difficult, but I absolutely think you can make things better. Iâ€™ve worked with lots of people in similar circumstances, believe it or not. You arenâ€™t alone in this ### if those people could improve their situations, then you can do the same. Get to work.\n",
      "Hello Ms. ###,I hope your Monday is well! I am an attorney in ### so my answer will be based on how things work in ###. Typically, an SSD benefit can be garnished if the amount ordered is not covered by the benefit given by SSA. From the sounds of your post it seems as though the benefit given to your son exceeds the $###.### $### $200. In that instance in ### there is an over payment by any funds being deducted from your SSD benefit. Additionally, any amounts received through the SSD benefit in excess of the ordered child support would typically be applied toward any arrears owed. When there is over-payment the amounts cannot be collected back to the paying party. They instead are treated as a credit towards the account. Which in essence means that if you were in ### you will not get the money back but you will also not have to pay the amounts and the garnishment should stop until such time as you actually owe money either through the ending of your SSD benefit or an increase in your obligation through the courts. There is language in your order that suggests you would be exempted from a garnishment based on the fact that your SSD benefit exceeds the amount ordered under number ### ###. If this were in ### I would be filing a motion to terminate the garnishment due to the SSD coverage along with a claim against any Arrears. However, I do not know the process in ### or the available remedies in this situation. As I am not an ### Attorney, I cannot give you advice. However, you should to seek out an attorney who handles child support modification matters that is familiar with SSD benefits, in order to best determine your path forward, especially with removing the garnishment from your SSD benefit. This is the link to the lawyer referral service https://###bar.org/for-lawyers/lawyer-referral-service/. If there is a possibility of getting this resolved to end the garnishment, they would likely be the best resource to help you.  As well with your status on SSD you may be entitled to help through the free legal services.I hope this helps you in seeking out a solution.Cordially,### ### \n",

      "Hi there, TERM0006###5. Thanks for posting. Iâ€™ll take your questions consecutively:(###) You canâ€™t write a letter to the judge, no. But you can file a motion for an emergency hearing. This is a tool thatâ€™s abused often, but in your case it sounds like you have legitimate cause: if the parties wait until ###, then the property may be adversely affected and both parties may be prejudiced. Ask the clerkâ€™s office how to follow their local procedure for requesting an emergency hearing. The clerkâ€™s office canâ€™t give you legal advice (â€œWhat should I do?â€) but they can give you information (â€œHow do I do this?â€). They are the best source for local procedures.(###) Thatâ€™s a broad question (â€œwill the defendant benefit in any way?â€) that would require me to know a lot more about the case and ### circumstances. But I think I can answer the spirit of your question by saying that the courtâ€™s goal is to achieve an equitable distribution of ### if that means a house, then okay, and if it means proceeds from a house that was sold, then okay. Whatever form the particular asset takes, thatâ€™s what the court will deal with. If the house burned down tomorrow, then the court would deal with the property and the insurance payout. If the land fell into a ###, then the court would deal with the insurance payout. Et cetera. Assets can transform, and the court can navigate that.(###) If your hearing was continued to ###, then the hearing is still open and new documents can still be presented. You can submit them by mail or bring them with you on ###.(###) You can request interest, yes. Itâ€™s difficult to answer the calculation question without knowing a lot more about the assets that are involved. As a general rule, you can think about family court this way: youâ€™re entitled to advocate for whatever you think youâ€™re entitled to, if you think you can make that argument ###. For example, maybe you can tell the court, â€œI have a ### savings account with Chase Bank where I keep my liquid assets. Thatâ€™s where I would have put this $TERM00133### received it back in May. So I should get interest based on that ### rate.â€ I can tell you that most courts will probably be reluctant to award interest on a payment thatâ€™s just a few months late, but you can certainly make the argument and you might get lucky.I hope thatâ€™s helpful, TERM0006###5.

If your ex-boyfriend were holding your property hostage, then you would have legal recourse. You could sue to compel him to return your property, or to compensate you for its loss.

You left ### for Maryland without taking your property, and you are (so far) declining to return to ### to collect it. From a legal standpoint, you are abandoning that property.I'd suggest you make a list of the property and figure out exactly what it's all worth, both in ### terms and in sentimental value. If it's worth enough, then you can go back yourself. Or if it's worth enough and if your ex-boyfriend is agreeable, then you can hire someone in ### to collect the property and ship it to you.

      "Hi there, ###. Thanks for posting.It sounds like you could benefit from some in-person legal assistance, especially because there is apparently a language barrier. I would suggest that you contact the ### Legal Services Corporation and ask what options might exist that are accessible to you:https://www.alsc-law.org/contact-us/It sounds like your husband is trying to convince you into doing something that's inappropriate (concealing assets from the court). It's possible that he's being truthful when he tells you that it's solely for convenience, but it's also possible that he is doing this to take advantage of you. Based on my experience with these types of cases, I think that's more likely: that he's trying to take advantage of you.The purpose of the court's divorce process is simple: the couple presents a complete, truthful evaluation of their assets and liabilities, and then they figure ### the court's ### to divide those assets and liabilities now that they are separating from a couple into two individuals. Nobody should be hiding assets. That's how people get taken advantage of. Everybody should be open and forthcoming about every piece of the financial puzzle. It's in everybody's best interests.The family court is pretty helpful in terms of providing assistance walking you through forms, etc. Contact your local courthouse to ask about resources for in-person guidance:https://courts.###.gov/courtdir/4fa.htmHere's a basic resource that can give you information about representing yourself in family court:https://courts.###.gov/shc/representing-yourself.htmI hope that's helpful, ###.

      "If attending tomorrow's hearing in person will cause you economic hardship, contact the court and ask to attend by telephone.  You'll need to deal with this ###.  Sometimes the creditor just gives up, but that hasn't happened here.   Since the problem is not going to go away, it's probably best to work out a payment plan you can live with.   You can probably discharge (get rid of) the debt by filing bankruptcy, but if this judgment is your only financial problem, a payment plan would probably be a better idea.It looks like tomorrow's show-cause hearing is being held because you didn't show up for a judgment debtor exam (###).   If the reason you didn't show up was that the plaintiff served your landlord and you didn't know about the ### in time to attend, explain that to the judge.   The judge may decide that you weren't required to show up because service on a landlord is not appropriate service.   (If the landlord is more like a roommate, however, you probably were served properly.)The judge is not going to throw you in jail, at least not at tomorrow's hearing.   It's likely, however, that the judge will require you to show up for a ### in the near future.   A ### is a session in court at which the plaintiff's attorney gets to ask you questions about what money or other assets you have that might be available to pay the judgment.   (Don't take money or jewelry with you, since it's not unusual for the plaintiff's attorney to ask you what you have with you and to make you turn that over to the court.  You'd probably get it all back eventually, but meanwhile you've lost the use of your cash and other stuff.)If you are behind on taxes and are just getting by financially, then it's possible that you don't have anything that the plaintiff can take from you permanently to pay the judgment, other than part of your PFD if someone else hasn't beaten them to it.  (The plaintiff tried to take part of your PFD for several years but didn't get anything, so either you're not getting one or someone else is taking yours.)    You are entitled to claim a lot of stuff as exempt (protected against being taken to pay a court judgment).   The court has a booklet that has information about exemptions.

      "The note you signed says that FNH can require you to pay their expenses, including legal fees, if FNH has notified you in writing that FNH is accelerating the note (declaring the entire principal and interest due).   One way to interpret that provision is that FNH doesn't have a right to recover fees incurred before accelerating the note.   So, did FNH ever send you a written notice that they were accelerating the note?   (Before you take this position, it would be a good idea to look at the deed of trust (mortgage) also since that document probably includes a provision dealing with legal fees, and that provision might be less favorable to you than the provision in the note.)As you consider what to do, please keep in mind that it may not be a good idea to pick a fight with FNH over the legal fees.   If your payments are still behind, you'll need FNH's cooperation to work out a payment plan if you don't want to put your home at risk.     You might also ask FNH if they're willing to compromise on the legal fees.   Instead of making you pay now or soon, they could add those fees to the principal balance of the note (which means you'd make payments for a longer period of time).   \n",

      "Can the court order the mortgage company to allow me to take over a mortgage or work with me on a refinance if i am on the title but not the mortgage holder? In the original divorce, I was given the right of first refusal to either buy out or put the property up for sale and receive 100% of the equity. I ended up moving out because There were circumstances beyond my control. After I moved out the Person on the mortgage moved in and refused to pay the mortgage or let any realtors and potential buyers to enter the home to view it. The judge has since ordered that he (the mortgage holder) choose a realtor and that the home would be reduced by 10% each year until it sells. Currently, the realtor is trying to lower the price and this point we are looking at a short sale. Unfortunately, the other party is refusing to comply with the court order to reduce the price and continues to not allow potential buyers and the realtor to view the inside of the home. I want to take over the mortgage and move back into the home. Can the court order the mortgage company to work with me on a mortgage takeover and possibly a refinance at a lower rate? Would it be best to try to work with the realtor to see if she can get the mortgage company to allow me to purchase at a reduced price? Thank you,### ###\n",
      "Hi, ### --The court cannot order the mortgagee (person/bank to whom the loan is owed) to do anything if the mortgagee is not a party to the court case.   And, even if the mortgagee were a party to the court case, there is pretty much no chance that the court could, or would, order the mortgagee to modify the mortgage in any way.   The court can, however, issue and enforce orders that, as between you and ###, affect the house and the mortgage.   For example, the court can (in appropriate circumstances):Order him to move out (and have the police/Troopers forcibly remove him if he refuses) Order him to transfer his share of the house to you (and, probably, require you to assume responsibility for the mortgage, payments including making up any late payments).   But, an order between you and ### is NOT binding on the mortgagee, so ###'s name will still be on the mortgage even if he's no longer on title.  And, the court might require you to get his name off the mortgage as a condition of letting you take over.  If the mortgage is in default (payments are behind) and the house is worth less than is owed on it (which is the reason for a short sale), then it's possible that the mortgagee will consider a ### that allows you to take title and assume responsibility for the mortgage.   But, it's usually difficult (and often impossible) to arrange a ### when, as here, the current owner/borrower refuses to cooperate.   And, you'd probably need to qualify financially to take over the mortgage (enough income; acceptable ### ratio; acceptable credit score).### B.\n",
      "Hi, That answers my questions perfectly. I just thought of one more question though. If I were to get an attorney what kind would I need? Would a Real Estate attorney handle a case like this? And are there any attorneys who would be willing to take this on as Pro Bono? I am a 5 ### single mother of a son who has Down Syndrome. My intention is to make a Short Sale offer to the mortgage company and I may need the attorney for court in order to get the other party to cooperate. Thank you again!\n",
      "Sometimes having a good lawyer can make all the difference, but here the problem with hiring a lawyer is that no lawyer can guarantee that you'll get the result you want.    The mortgagee (or its loan servicer) probably isn't going to pay a lot more attention to inquiries from a lawyer than from you or your realtor.  If you're dealing with one of the big nationwide loan servicers, your house is just one of thousands of defaulted-loan files being handled by minions who have no real decision-making authority.   Very often, trying to get any action or decision on a proposed short sale or assumption can be an exercise in ###, regardless who makes the inquiry (you or a lawyer).   As to getting a pro bono attorney, you can try ### Legal Services if you qualify financially.  Had you considered simply giving up on the house?   If the house is under water (worth less than is owed on it), there's no equity to rescue.  If your name isn't on the mortgage or loan, then presumably the overdue payments aren't showing up on your credit report or hurting your credit score.   \n",

That there was an occurrence of violence and that the divorce began as contested but that you and Dad ended up settling.To change an existing custody order you will want to file a motion to modify custody with the court.  See the court provided form here:  http://www.courts.###.gov/shc/family/docs/shc-###500n.pdf  See the court's guidance regarding modifying custody here:  http://www.courts.###.gov/shc/family/shcmodify.htm Generally, to modify an existing court order, the court will need to make a finding that there has been a substantial change of circumstances and that the existing custody order is not appropriate.  The judge will make that finding based on evidence supplied by both sides.  Your order is the first step to explaining to the court that there has been a substantial change in circumstances.  You will send the motion to court and to Dad and Dad will get a chance to oppose your motion and then you can file a reply to Dad's opposition.  Moving out of state is generally accepted as a substantial change of circumstances.  Still, it's a big step and courts generally want to see kids have both parents around when possible.  To decide whether to modify custody the court will do what is called a best interest factors analysis (you can look it up ### Statute ###5.######.###50):(###) the physical, emotional, mental, religious, and social needs of the child;(###) the capability and desire of each parent to meet these needs;(###) the child's preference if the child is of sufficient age and capacity to form a preference;(###) the love and affection existing between the child and each parent;(5) the length of time the child has lived in a stable, satisfactory environment and the ### of maintaining continuity;(6) the willingness and ability of each parent to facilitate and encourage a close and continuing relationship between the other parent and the child, except that the court may not consider this willingness and ability if one parent shows that the other parent has sexually assaulted or engaged in domestic violence against the parent or a child, and that a continuing relationship with the other parent will endanger the health or safety of either the parent or the child;(7) any evidence of domestic violence, child abuse, or child neglect in the proposed custodial household or a history of violence between the parents;(8) evidence that substance abuse by either parent or other members of the household directly affects the emotional or physical well-being of the child;(9) other factors that the court considers pertinent.From the court's website re parenting plans,http://courts.###.gov/shc/family/shcplan.htm:In cases where a parent wants to move with the child and the other parent wants the child to stay in the same community where he/she has been living, the judge uses a ###-step process to determine the best interests of the child.Is the planned move legitimate? (The reason for the move canâ€™t be to deny the non-moving parent time with the child. Some examples of legitimate reasons may be a better paying job, enrolling in a special education program, family support.)If the move is legitimate, the judge considers the best interest factors to determine the arrangement that serves the best interests of the child. This requires looking at the consequences to the child both:if the parent leaves with the child, andif the parent leaves without the child.And one more suggestion, if you have concerns about Dad but don't feel like you can adequately raise them you can look into the custody investigator program.  It's a third party that meets with everyone individually and then reports back to the judge what they think the custody arrangement should be.  Yeah, it's awkward for a kid to have to talk to them but easier than the kid to have to testify about their parents in open court.Hope this helps, ###\n",

      "Hi ###,You need to know if there are any liens on the property, like a deed of trust (mortgage). Most loan agreements have provisions that require permission from the lender before transferring title. Other liens, like construction liens or judgment liens, will stay attached to the property with the transfer. It doesn't necessarily put the new owner in a position to be personally liable, but they could lose the property and any improvements they made to the property.You'll still probably want to put a nominal consideration ($###) in the deed - consideration (payment) is a requirement of a valid contract.The problem I see you having though is drafting the documents. I really think you'll need a lawyer there. It's not a huge task, but it's just complicated enough that you want a professional to handle it. If you are really determined, you can use a standard quit claim deed form (I included a link below). You'll need the legal description of the property, but that should be on the last deed. You can also look it up online. Just make sure you have a few originals to file with the register of deeds. I can't remember ### how many originals you need, but you can call the register of deeds in your district to double-check.http://alyeskatitle.com/downloads/quit_claim_deed.pdfAll that said, I still think you should have a lawyer draft the documents and get a title policy from a title insurance company. Hope this helps. Let me know if you have any questions.Take care.Best,Will ###\n",

We are being told we have no choice but to accept this as the person in the house signed a lease for ###st. Is it legal for the property manager and property owner to do this? There is nothing in our lease that says they can or cannot do this. An additional concern is that this laundry room, and the outside outlets and lights are ALL on our electric meter (Apartment ####). We are being charged for this common area, and we pay the electric ### in full. We were supposed to be reimbursed the difference between the electric ###s between apartment ### ###, which IS in our lease agreement. The property manager who took over in ###TERM000###95, is working on getting us credit or reimbursed the difference, but has NOT said how this would work with a 3rd person using the laundry facilities. The owner of the property has known about us being charged electric for the common area for over a year. We did not find this out until an electrician was sent out to do some work and WE ASKED the old property management company to check who was being charged as our electric ### was really outrageous and substantially higher than the previous apartment I lived in before moving to the current address. Do we have any rights to tell them no, that the house next door cannot use the laundry room and is it legal that the common area is on our electric? Our lease is up on ###st, and I do not know if we will be able to afford a new place to live in as I gradate in May, but COVID-###Ã© is laid off due to COVID-###9. I feel that we are being taken advantage of and that not knowing our rights is putting us at a disadvantage. Thank you for any advice or shared legal informant regarding our tenant rights. We really appreciate your time. \n",
      "Hello!  Hope you are doing well hunkered down at home.  Could you attach a copy of your lease?  If that isn't possible, could you type in the parts of the lease that discuss the laundry facility, utilities, and common areas?  It will help me to answer your questions.  Thanks!\n",
      "Donâ€™t worry â€“ our communications through this service are private and confidential.Your landlord should not be able to give a third party access to the laundry for your duplex. Your landlord rented the duplex premises to you and the occupants of unit ####.  There is nothing in your lease specifying that the landlord can allow others access to the premises, including the laundry or other common areas.  To the contrary, your lease states that the landlord may only enter the premises â€œfor the purpose of making inspections, repairs or alterations to the premises or building.â€  Letting someone else use the laundry is certainly not an inspection or repair. If I understand your documents correctly, the one that starts â€œLaundry situation to remain the sameâ€ is the attachment that was added to your lease when it was amended in TERM00065###.  â€œLaundry situationâ€ could interpreted in a number of ways.  But you can certainly take the position that â€œlaundry situation to remain the sameâ€ means only units ### ###.  If this document was attached with your lease amendment, this is part of your lease.  The landlord should not be able to change the lease and the laundry use without your written agreement. Giving a third party access to your laundry and other common area also ### your ability to meet your lease obligations.  Under the lease, you are required to keep the common area, including the laundry, clean and free of items.  If any items are left in the area you are liable for their disposal.  Letting a third party use your common area creates an obligation for you to clean up after that person and be liable for item that the third party leaves in your area. As to the electricity use, you should seek reimbursement.  You have an email from ###, followed by a ### ####.  You can ask for reimbursement going at least back to ######.  If you havenâ€™t been submitting your ###s for your landlord to process the ### on a regular basis, though, your landlord has not had the information to calculate the ###.        So what should you do about this?  Your ### about not wanting to rock the boat is probably a good one.  You have rights here, but trying to reach agreement can avoid a lot of time and effort fighting with your landlord.  I would raise your concerns (preferably in writing) about third party access that isnâ€™t provided for in your lease, the potential problems it raises with your obligations to keep the area clean, and the additional burden to your utility ### that the landlord is required to but has not been reimbursing.  Ask for an amendment to your lease that lays out access, use, and responsibilities for the common area, including laundry, as to all authorized users.  This amendment should also address the utility ###ing. For the ### you have not been collecting for your utility ###, consider how important it is for you to seek back ###.  If you want to pursue them, start with providing documentation and asking your landlord for the payments.  If the landlord refuses, you could take him to small claims court to enforce the agreement to reimburse part of your ###.  The less documentation of ###s that you have, and the less often you submitted them to your landlord all along, the more challenging it will be to go to court.  That said, you were smart to get the reimbursement agreement in writing, and that would help your case a lot.  Going to court can be time consuming and stressful, though.  You may want to try to make a deal with your landlord for some reimbursement â€” or even just ### going forward â€” and cut your losses for the rest. To summarize:  Your lease does not allow the landlord to give a third party access to use the laundry and imposes obligations on you to keep that area clean.  Through later communications and the ###, the landlord also agreed to reimburse you for utilities for this common area â€” but it sounds like you havenâ€™t been submitting the paperwork regularly to ask for the reimbursement.  If you want to, you can take your landlord to court if they refuse any ### or continue to let the new tenant use the laundry over your objections.  But reaching agreement with your landlord is frequently a better option that going to court.  A good option to address the situation would be to raise your concerns and ask for a written amendment to the lease specifying laundry use, responsibilities, and ###ing.  You might also bring up the past ###ing situation and suggest resolving those ### â€” and think about whether you want to compromise on how far back to go (taking into account how often you were submitting ###s to your landlord or how much documentation you have for figuring out the reimbursement amounts). Iâ€™m going to leave this matter open for a few days in case you have any questions about what Iâ€™ve written.  Best of luck and stay safe!\n",
      "Thank you for your response. It was very helpful. Just a couple more question when you get a moment. Is a landlord required by state law to have a separate meter for the common area (i.e.: the laundry room)? We agreed to being reimbursed the difference because we were told that the owners didn't have enough money to make the changes, but the 3rd member has already begun using the laundry facilities, and there is no way we can afford to pay that entire ###. The 3rd parties lease started on ###st.  Is there an agency that we can complain to? Or is small claims court our only option? We really want to avoid something like small claims court. Happy Easter. Your advice and time is greatly appreciated.Stay safe. \n"

However, before you do respond, you should talk to an attorney with experience with these kind of restraining orders. Usually, that is a family law attorney or a criminal defense attorney. That is because a restraining order petition always includes an accusation of crimes being committed.

      "Hi ###,Thank you for your questions.  I think you are right to have them.  You raise a couple of issues.First, both state and federal OSHA require proper certifications for employees engaged in hazardous cleanup work involving any risk of exposure, so this company could not ask you to perform hazardous cleanup work without a certification.  You can review the specific federal rules here. The state has a short pamphlet on hazardous substances here, which also lists contact information for the state.  If you pursue this position and it looks like they will have you perform hazardous cleanup without a certification, I would recommend calling the hotline number in the pamphlet to discuss the issue with the state investigators.Second, with regard to the medical examination, I think the company probably can require you to work ###.  Unlike some states, ### does not require companies to pay for pre-hire medical examinations.  So the company could ask you to pay for it up front.  It sounds like their job application treats their payment for the exam as a loan, which they will forgive if you work eight weeks.  Companies often do things like this with hiring bonuses.  If you do not work the required eight weeks, though, what they cannot do is take the exam fee from your paycheck.  ### permits companies to deduct from employee paychecks in very specific circumstances.  The state produces a helpful pamphlet with important wage laws, which you can find here. I encourage you to review it.  The section discussing what companies can keep from paychecks is on page 26 (the regulation number is ### 15.160).Finally, I am not very familiar with union requirements or whether the agent's referral outside the call/dispatch process is improper. But if you have specific concerns about the process I suggest raising it with the union. Please feel free to respond if any of this is not clear.  Good luck!  \n",

      "There is a technically-correct answer and a practical answer.  The technically-correct answer is this:If the new owner offered to lower the rent in exchange for signing a new lease, and you chose not to sign the new lease, then your old lease probably remained in effect (including the old rent amount).  If you had a month-to-month lease with rent payable on the first of the month and you wanted to move out at the end of May, you needed to give the landlord notice at least ### ###.   If you notified the landlord on ### that you would be moving, your notice would be effective as of the next rent due date that is at least ### ###.   That's ###.  So, you may potentially owe rent for ### unless the landlord can re-rent your place before the end of ### (in which case you get a credit for the part of ### that the place is rented to someone else).If you had a ### lease, not a month-to-month lease, then you might owe rent for July or after too, depending on how long your lease runs.The practical answer is this:Is the landlord holding a security deposit or a last-month's-rent deposit?   If so, the landlord probably will keep some or all of it, and there's probably not a lot you can, or should, do about that.  If the landlord doesn't have any money on deposit, do you think the landlord will sue you to try to collect just a month's rent (or less)?  Probably not.  It's a lot of hassle for not a lot of money.### B\n",

      "Hi, ### --Based on the paperwork you provided, Affordable has a valid judgment against you and has a legal right to try to collect it.   But, they shouldn't be taking money that is protected against court judgments, like SSD.Here is some more information:It's possible that, when they sued you in 2011, you might have been able to have the court dismiss Affordable's claim because they waited so long to sue you.   But, if you didn't raise that issue (statute of limitations) at the time, and if you agreed to a judgment, then it's probably way too late to do anything about that.I can't tell you what responsibility, if any, Johnsons (the dealership) has here without more information.   But, it's pretty likely that you signed paperwork agreeing to pay Affordable (or paperwork agreeing to pay Johnsons, and Johnsons legally transferred that paperwork to Affordable).  So, even if someone reviews your paperwork and gathers more information, the outcome is probably going to be that you owe the debt.The fact that you agreed to make, and are making, monthly payments does not prevent Affordable from trying to collect in other ways unless they agreed not to try to collect as long as you made your monthly payments.This judgment will never be paid off at $### (and probably not through Affordable's other collection efforts either).   The judgment allows Affordable to add 29% interest per year to the judgment amount -- that's over $###,### $10,425.47.   The judgment is dischargeable (can be wiped out) in bankruptcy.   So, if Affordable's collection efforts are creating hardship and stress for you, please talk with a bankruptcy attorney about filing bankruptcy.   It's also possible that ### Legal Services may be able to help you or to find a free attorney for you.There is some money that Affordable should not be trying to take, including your SSI payments.   If Affordable is knowingly taking money that is exempt from their judgment, that is against the law (even if the court eventually makes them give the money back to you).   Please talk with ### Legal Services about whether they can help you make a claim against Affordable for unlawful debt collection practices (or to use the threat of a claim as a way to negotiate a better outcome for you on the judgment).### B.\n",
      "Hi again, ### --When did the judge say that SSI/D benefits are not exempt?   If you're referring to the document you uploaded with your message, that document is not from the judge.   It's from Affordable's attorney, who is responding to your claim of exemptions.   The attorney's response concedes that your SSI/D money and adoption stipend are exempt but says that you had other money in your account too.   From what I see on Courtview, it looks like the judge agreed with that.Courtview also shows that the court released some money yesterday -- $###.###, and $###.### (I can't tell if that's going to you or being returned to your bank account, but you can probably find that out by calling the court). For your PFD, the Department of Revenue's website says there's another round of payments scheduled for ###.  I have two questions:Has this happened before -- Affordable taking all of the money in your account and then the court giving some or all of it back because some or all is from SSI/D?    Affordable should not be doing blanket bank garnishments if Affordable knows your account has protected money.   And, your bank should not be turning over any money that the bank knows comes from the Social Security Administration.Second, when Affordable last took money from your account, what was the source of the money that did not come from SSI/D or adoption stipend?   Was it SSI/D or adoption stipend money from a prior month?   The exempt portion of your PFD?  Something else?  ### B.\n",

      "Hi!  I am so sorry for everything you've been going through.  Unfortunately, there isn't one simple process for ### an adoption in ###.  But there are things you can do to address your situation.First, you can go ahead and change your last name.  Here's the forms and instructions for doing that:https://public.courts.###.gov/web/forms/docs/civ-698.pdfhttps://public.courts.###.gov/web/forms/docs/civ-699.pdfhttps://public.courts.###.gov/web/forms/docs/civ-700.pdfhttps://public.courts.###.gov/web/forms/docs/vs-405.pdfThat will get rid of Mr. ###'s name.  If you want to go further and eliminate him as your adoptive father, the best way to do that is to have Mr. ### adopt you.  This might sound unusual, but ### allows adults to be adopted.  This adoption would replace the one with Mr. ### so you would no longer have any legal ties to him.  The forms for an adoption can be found here:http://www.courts.###.gov/forms/index.htm#adopt To replace Mr. Trumblee on your birth certificate, you will need either your mother or Mr. ### to file a complaint to establish paternity.  You may need a DNA test or other proof of paternity.  This process could get more complicated, particularly if your mother disagrees.  I don't want to discourage you from pursuing this, but you might think about whether a name change and new adoption is enough for your needs.  If you do want to pursue establishing paternity and changing your birth certificate, information about the process and the required forms can be found here:http://www.courts.###.gov/shc/family/shcpaternity.htmAll of these processes require going to court.  The courts have needed to prioritize the most urgent matters during the Coronavirus pandemic, so don't be surprised if it takes some time to complete these.  Best of luck in your journey!\n",
      "###. We expressly purchased the animal with a breeding contract. As a part of the obligation of the contract we could not breed her before ###, by coincidence she must be ###. A condition she was GUARANTEED by the contract to be free from. We have documentation from Orthopedic Foundation of America that she does have the condition, and therefor is NOT able to be bred. We have stated on our Breeding web page that this is the case, we have had her spay- as the contract requires- but the breeder we bought her from has continually found issue to delay providing a new puppy of equal pedigree, while advertising ### for sale. Messages sent via email go weeks or months without response, the breeder has even changed their email address without notification. Phone calls are unanswered and messages are ignored. We have finally agreed to simply accept a refund of the purchase price. They now demand we sign a hold harmless agreement to receive the refund. The breeder is out of state, in Ohio, and part of the agreement they want us to sign says all legal action would take place there. This seems foolish for us to agree to. Small claims with an out of state defendant would probably be unenforceable if heard. would it be possible to sue for lost income due to the delays, IE the ### lost n the interim (that would be approximately$###) , the cost of transportation to get the original pup, and cost of Vet care and upkeep of the pup. With the court and legal fees? That would bring the amount sought to $### $###. Well beyond small claims. Of course that would be a drawn out process with a unsure conclusion. Do we have additional options?? We do have the original purchase contract, all veterinary reports, the OFA report, and all electronic communication with the individual.\n",

      "Hi!Thank you for your question.  Your child support payment will be determined based on a percentage of your income.  Certain expenses are taken into account.

      "If she was an owner of a Native Allotment or a Native Townsite lot, the only way the land can be administered is through the ### process. That process usually starts with the Tribe or Village where the deceased person was registered. Check with the Tribal Council office to see if the have a realty officer. Some tribes or villages don't have their own realty office, so they use a nearby larger tribe's office or the ### itself. Either way, the proper realty officer will help you prepare an application to probate the will with a ### hearing officer. Only the ### has the power to make a final decision about transferring the ownership of a deceased ### Native or Indian landowner.You mentioned that the BLM was also involved. It's possible that your decedent also owned ### land. If that is the case, then the will might have to be probated in State court as well as in the ###. The realty officer at the tribal office might be able to tell you if that's necessary. The fact that someone filed a record with the State Recorder shouldn't make any difference with the ###. In fact, the ### encourages Native landowners to file their documents with the Recorder, so that the world can see that it's Native land.\n",

If you pay the damage in whole, you can show proof of that with a notarized general release from the person you made the payments to.

I.e., if you haven't filed an answer to the divorce complaint, you should deny the marriage date set forth and put forth the more recent date. Further complicating things is that a judge has some discretion to consider pre-marital property in the division of property for divorce. Surely this isn't the firm answer you were hoping, but like everything with divorce law, it can be more complicated.

      "Filing bankruptcy without an attorney is possible -- many people do it, but it can get tricky. Here's a link to a website put out by the US Courts that can explain the process a little: ### As that website says, finding a bankruptcy attorney to help you could be well worth it. In a nutshell, the process involves attending a credit counseling class before you file, then preparing a long list of forms to list all the property you own versus all the debts that you owe, explaining what your income is to see if you have the ability to pay some of your debts, and explaining what you financial activities have been for the last year or so, the purpose being to see if you've been running up debts unreasonably or trying to hide property. If you have excess property, the bankruptcy court can force a sale of some of the property to pay off some of your debts. If your paperwork shows that you could pay off a percentage of your debts by filing a Chapter ### 7, you can be forced into a 13. There will be at least one court hearing, maybe more depending on what your petition shows and whether anyone objects to your case. Again, these are things a bankruptcy attorney can really help with.\n",
      "We live in Delta Junction, ###. My father inlaw would like to name an executor of his estate. So he did a very basic, simple Last Will and Testament. To make this document valid can he sign it with a notary of the public? Or does he need to witnesses present to sign as well? If he does need witnesses, can they be anybody? I've searched online but can't find a straight answer. He would like to keep the process simple but also ensure it follows legal guidelines to ensure its validity when he passes. Thank You so much for your help.    \n",
      "Hi ###,I am sorry to hear that your former employer has refused to pay your final paycheck. Your understanding is correct that a company must pay you everything it owes you within three working days of your termination.  If it refuses to do so, your options to enforce the law are: (###) filing a wage claim with the department of labor; or (###) bringing a lawsuit or finding an attorney to bring a lawsuit on your behalf. Before taking any of those steps, though, it might be worth making sure the company knows the rules that apply to wage claims, which may make it more willing to pay what it owes.  Most helpful are the following laws that apply to wage claims:If a company fails to pay an employee what it legally owes, it can be required to pay the employee double that amount.  AS ###3.###0.######0(a).If an employee has to bring a lawsuit to get what it is owed, the company is required to pay for the employee's attorney.  AS ###3.###0.######0(c).The statutes I cite above can be found here.   Also, I would do your best to save all communications with your company about this issue, and also collect whatever records you have of the hours you worked for which you have not been paid.  If you do file a wage claim or a lawsuit, clear and complete documentation will make it a lot easier.Also, if you do file a wage claim, be aware that it might take a while for the department to investigate and resolve your claim.  I am not very familiar with their procedures, but I know that sometimes they can work very slowly.  I would reach out to the department if you have specific questions about the process.  Their contact information is here.Good luck!\n",
      "Hello,Thank you very much for such a quick reply. Between the pandemic, holidays, severe ### pain (and powerful pain meds I don't want to make legal decisions while taking), ###s couldn't be a worse time for me to face these new landlord issues. I'm sure you're busy, too, and appreciate your time.I should add that I'm okay with paying another $###. Current rent $###, now wants $###. The change I do not like is he wants to change it to month-to-month. I cannot move with only ###. I've been 100% legally disabled with ### issues more than ###, which they know, and now have to recovery from major surgery. I cannot drive, barely walking and will be on pain meds for several weeks. I'm incapacitated right now and will be for a while. I planned ###s surgery so that I'd be able to move by the end of ###000188 and I suspect they will give me notice to move by  ### which would force me to hire packers instead of doing it myself. That will cost thousands that I cannot afford.My second major concern is ###, I owe them all kinds of money. I wonder if they're trying to scam me out of that money? You'll see ###.I will ask my son to help me get the current lease to you as soon as possible. The issue is my scanner, so I might need a cable. But, to save time, if ###s helps, I have typed/copied the current lease ###s that may apply below.  I've ### what I ###nk is important.Thank you again, ###Applicable Lease ###s:1-Lessor leases to lessee and lessee leases from lessor, upon the ###s and conditions herein, for the period commencing on ###, 2016, and thereafter until the ###, 2017, at which time ### lease agreement shall automatically renew each year unless ###nated in writing. The lessee is required to give the lessor a notice in writing ### (###) in advance of his/her moving. Notice must be given on the first day of the month. If notice is given after the first day of the month, the ### (###) notice will not start until the following month. (The notice must be one full calendar month starting on the first day of the month.) Rent may be increased at any time after the first year and the security deposit can not be used for rent.  1.The lessor has the right to sell the property duing the lease. The lessor will give the lessee ###rty day's notice if there is a sale of the property. The lease agreement will become void in the event of a sale.                                                                                                                       12.Should any portion of ###s lease be found to be invalid or unenforceable, the remainder of the lease shall not be affected thereby, and each ### and provision herein shall be valid and enforceable to the fullest extent permitted by law,13. All rights given to lessor by ###s lease shall be cumulative to any other laws which might exist or come into being. Any exercise or failure to exercise by lessor of any right shall not act as a  waiver of any other rights. No statement or promise of lessor of or his agent as to tenancy, repairs, alterations, or other ###s and conditions shall be binding unless reduced to writing and signed by lessor.35. All parties agree that ###ination of ###s agreement prior to the ###ination date will constitute breach of the tenancy and all security deposits and one month's full rent shall be forfeited in favor of lessor as liquidated damages plus you will be charged the cost of restoring the property to rental condition plus advertising and rent loss incurred until the new resident moves in. Your liability for rent loss is limited to ###rty (30) days after restoratio is complete.\n",
      "Hi, I understand completely. I just tried texting ###, not sure if they went through. Mine is not a smart phone. I will mail copies to you today if there's mail, if not then Saturday. In the meantime, I'll try to get help to get it to you sooner. If at all possible, if you got the ###, pls text to let me know and I'll have my son help me finish it. (My hands are shaky from meds.) I will email him what you suggested. Thank you very much for that and everything, especially during the holidays. I'm trying my best to get what you need to help me. I truly appreciate it. \n",
      "Okay, thank you for trying. I'm sorry I'm so clueless about technology. Once my son gets here, he may know how to post on this site. Either way, I will copy and mail both leases to you. Thank you again, so very very much. Happy Holidays.\n",
      "Okay.   I hope you and yours have a nice Christmas!\n",
      "I found a way to get the copies to you. If they are open today and if my son can go (if not, then Monday), there's a Mail Boxes Etc nearby that can fax and/or make copies and send prioirty mail. I'll ask him to fax it to your # above AND send copies viaPriority Mail to you on ### Rd since I'm not sure which is quicker and/or easier for you.Once you've received it, my three priorities are to (###) stay until the end of TERM000###88 (###) not be on a month to month lease or change any other terms in the lease except rent going up $###00  and (###) be guaranteed not to be charged what they're saying in ###. These are folks who ###l try to wrangle anything they can.I'm okay with paying the rent increase but just want an ammendment/other document (anything other than a new lease) that says rent increase only, no other change of any terms at all, and have it be written in as valid from ### through ### to prevent further rent increases.I'd prefer to wait to give them notice but am okay with throwing that bone out there if you think it would help. I do NOT want to sign a whole new lease unless the law requires me to do so. I never in my life sign month to month because I have been disabled with mobility/bad back and leg issues almost twenty years. I ###l not sign one here because as soon as I do, I fully expect they ###l give me ### ###. He (### ###) told me they plan to sell asap. I get the ### ### and then start several weeks of physical therapy. I can hardly walk even with a ### and still take ###  several times a day. I planned, timed, and coordinated this process many mon### ago, planning to move when the lease runs out this TERM000###88 and am pysically unable to do so until then. All of my doctors know this. My counselor is fully aware of everything they've been putting me through, but she and I do not speak until mid January when I ### update her.  These landlords have caused me a huge amount os stress, fear, etc since I got mad when they entered my space unnannounced. fyi-in case it matters, the new lease has errors, ommissions and ###If my son can helps me get ### ###e today, I'll send you another message here in case you are checking. If not, it should go out Monday and at your convenience is very much appreciated.  Thank you very much.\n",
      "I've looked at the paperwork you sent.   Here are my comments:As to the lease ###, you have a ###001120 lease that ends on ###.   The lease automatically renews for another year unless you or your landlord gives timely notice that the lease will not be renewed.   Your landlord's new lease probably constitutes notice that the landlord does not intend to renew the lease for another year.   But, I don't think your landlord can make you move out before ### or sign a new lease.   I also don't think your your landlord is saying he wants you to move.   Do you want to stay after ### if you have a choice, even if you then have a month-to-month tenancy instead of a one-year lease?As to rent, your lease isn't clear on whether the landlord can raise the rent in the middle of a lease year.   But, if you are okay with a $###, then it's probably in your best interest to accept and pay the increase instead of ### whether your landlord can raise the rent mid-year.As to Paragraph 35, I don't think that applies here.   It's a provision that's probably intended to address the situation in which the tenant moving out early.  But, you've said you don't intend to move out early (before ###), so that provision shouldn't be an issue.I can help you write a response to your landlord if you wish.\n",
      "Okay, thank you! I will send them that email. Is it possible to keep this 'open' so that I can reach you for a follow up question if they do something else before I move? If not, I understand. I really appreciate your time and effort. I wish you a Happy and Healthy New Year! Thank you again from the bottom of my heart.\n",
      "Thank you again. I will check the site periodically as well. If I ever do need to reach you after this thread is closed, my email is ###. Have a wonderful 2021!\n",
      "Seems like closing notices coming more often. I'll check more to keep it open. I'll be sending my notice per the lease to landlords in March, trying to find a new place. So I'd like to keep this open if more questions arise throughout my move out process. Thank you.\n",
      "Great! Thank you.Starting to view potential new homes. I think the landlord may agree to an early move out if I need to do that, but we'll see how it goes. Thanks again.\n",
      "Hello, I just realized if I'm starting to apply for rentals, they will need to contact my current landlord for a reference. I don't want them to be surprised like that, so thought I'd send the email below. I usually email every month about the rent, so thought this was a good opportunity. I'm trying to act in good faith and hope they 'get' that. I thought the rent, unofficial notice, and sink repair was enough for now. I can always ask about move out date flexibility later if I need it. I can't move out before our stuff on the patio thaws out enough to be moved. It's buried ###.Can you please tell me f my email looks okay? Is there anything in it I should remove or edit or anything I should add? I was hoping to send it before Wednesday when I view my two best prospects for new homes.Thank you very much.DRAFT:Hi,I sent the rent electronically this morning. Please let me know if you do not get it.I also wanted to let you know while we have enjoyed living here for the last five years, we have decided not to renew the lease beyond ###21. Per our lease, I will send proper notice before the end of the month, but wanted to give you the benefit of early notice.  In reference to the lease, I want to be sure I do everything required. I have a total of eight (8) signed pages between us. I believe this constitutes our entire written agreement but please correct me if I'm wrong. The first six pages are the residential lease agreement, the seventh page is exhibit A and the eighth and final page is the marijuana addendum.           Do you have any documents we both signed other than the eight pages above? Please let me know if you do so I can plan accordingly. Lastly, during the quake last week, I was in the master bedroom and heard a clinking sound in the master bath as some of my dresser drawers opened from the shake. I looked in the bathroom and saw the sink stopper had fallen. I used the handle to lift it up but the stopper did not move. I was able to remove the stopper because it was not connected to anything and just lifted out. I googled it and it is far beyond anything I can do. It's not a big deal to me to let the repair wait, especially since I'm moving soon. I have a rubber stopper in that sink so nothing falls into the drain pipe. I hardly use that sink except to wash hands and brush teeth, so for me it's not at all urgent. I'm also under the weather and need more time to get better. Between my leg surgery and other health problems, it's been a rough winter for my health. Please let me know 1-if you do not get the rent; ### you have any other documents; and ### you're okay with waiting a few weeks to fix the stopper. Thank you very much, ### Drago\n",
      "Hi,I'll be applying for a new place tomorrow. They will contact my landlord for a reference, so I'll need to tell him to expect a call. I can't wait because he won't like being surprised.

I know this is short notice but I couldn't help that.  just saw the new place today.  I only edited the first paragraph and the last few in the email.

If I am able to be out before the end of ###, possibly by mid month, would you want access to start whatever work you have pl###d? I'm open to and happy to working with you about this to our mutual benefit. It's something to think about. My only concern is our belongings on the patio that might not be ### and ### by then, but I'm happy to work that out with you as well. I wish to make this as easy a transition, for both of us, as possible.  I am actively seeking a new home and you may be contacted as a reference from potential new landlords. I expect a man named ### will be contacting you soon. Please let me know 1-if you have any other documents; and ### you're okay with waiting a few weeks to fix the stopper.

      "I'm glad to hear that you've found a new place that you like, and I hope that works out for you.You asked if there's a point at which you can legally assume that your landlord has paper doesn't have any other paperwork.  The answer is no.  But, it probably doesn't help to keep asking.  You've asked and you can document that you asked.   You've done what you need to do.  If you're concerned about your security deposit, before you're ready to move out, check what your lease and other paperwork say about scheduling a walkthrough, etc., and follow that procedure.   If there isn't a prescribed procedure (I haven't looked at the lease to see), then you'll want to contact your landlord before moving and schedule a walk-through at which the landlord can inspect the premises and tell you if there's anything else you need to do to get your security deposit back.   The part that you don't control is whether your landlord will claim deductions that the landlord isn't entitled to, such as for ordinary wear and tear.  All you can do is make sure you know what the landlord says you need to do before your tenancy ends so you can make an informed decision about how to proceed.\n",

I won't know until then whether I'll have more physical therapy appointments on my schedule.

      "If you'll be done with your work before ###, it wouldn't hurt to schedule the walkthrough for a date sooner than ### so that, if the landlord wants more work done (and you agree that the request is warranted), you'll have a chance to complete that work before your lease ends.On the keys, if the landlord doesn't make arrangements to retrieve them in person, ask the landlord whether he wants you to mail the keys or leave them inside with the deadbolt left unlocked.  \n",
      "I just sent ### this email: \"Good morning ###,Just saw your message. Which neighbor are you talking about? I ###'t understand what the issue is. Please elaborate. I am not feeling well and have been trying to sleep since yesterday, so please email, not call or text, so you ###'t wake me up again.Thank you very much, ###\"\n",
      "Okay, thanks. I didn't know what to do about the neighbor. I expect to receive no deposit back and that i'll need to take them to small claims. I've done it before for other civil matters. I expect they'll refuse a walkthrough, but I will save receipts for all hired work and photo everything I do. I'll just continue to act in good faith and do my best to get through this.Thank you!\n",
      "That was a positive, productive response from the guy at the City,   And, I'm glad to hear that the space is getting plowed so quickly.\n",
      "Me, too! Problem solved. I always had off street parking until moving in here. ### told me not to park in front of other houses and we never have except for an occasional drop ### up right after my knee replacement in December and I could barely walk. I didn't know it was customary not to leave a parked car in front of your own house. There's a ton of them in my neighborhood, so thought it was okay. If ### or ### had said something sooner, we would have reacted then. Anyway...Thank you!Quick follow up. Spoke with your landlord, Mr. ###.  He advised he was trying to do the right thing for the neighborhood and was going to have his plow guys remove the berm caused by the vehicle from your unit.  I commended him for trying to ### everyone but said Iâ€™d have Street Maintenance take care of it.  As I suspected he knew it was you who complained, mentioned it and I advised even though that was his believe I couldnâ€™t verify it.  Mr. ### also brought up on his own there was a pile of snow in the rear which he was going to have removed that was temporary only.  I spoke with Street Maintenance and they will go out and take care of the berm issue and may already have.  Mr. Mcann also stated, on his own, that you believe you will be charged for the ### but would not.  I figured Iâ€™d go ahead an pass the info along. Although technically illegal under the color of the law, if a plow operator has the opportunity to fix a simple issue such as this without negatively impacting the area or causing a safety hazard, I have no problem with it happening on an occasional basis.  In this case I intervened to hopefully resolve the situation for all parties involved.  Please keep this in mind for the future as the ### is working tirelessly right now to remove all this snow and looking forward to ### temperatures.I hope they leav me alaone for now.\n",
      "Hi,I want to be sure I do everything the lease requires regarding utilities and shut off dates. I called Chugach electric and Enstar gas this morning and will call the water company tomorrow.Enstar gas said they have some sort of agreement or other document on file automatically putting the gas back into ###'s name when mine is taken off. Since ### is a Friday, they will have someone come out on the 30th for a final read between ### ###. Once that is read, they switch it into ###'s name. I get a final statement in ###-###. I plan to estimate and prepay more than my estimate so I have proof of being paid in full for ###. (Any credit will carry over to my new account.) I think this is all okay. If not, please advise.Chugach electric is closed on weekends, so I could choose Friday the 30th at any time between 8am and 5pm or Monday, ###rd which I do not wish to do. I will need electricity to do a walk through if ### agrees, so Chugach suggested I ask him to call them to transfer the account on ###/30. I doubt he will agree to a walk through or to make this call or to even respond to me. But, I do need minimum ###8-###. So, I scheduled it for ###/###. What should I do? Am I obligated by the lease or law to keep electricity on beyond the 30th giving ### free power all weekend or can it be turned off before 11:### 30th which they won't/can't do? Do I email ### now about scheduling the walk through (I would ask for as early as possible on the 30th so we might still have power) and ask him about the electric? I'm really confused about the electric and my legal obligations.Thank you.\n",
      "You did tell me to ask for a walk through a few days early. Thanks for reminding me as I'd forgotten.I'll wait until after Easter and then email to ask him to schedule it for ### or ### ###% ###e. My carpet cleaner is coming on the 29th which should be the last thing that needs to be ###e. I'm actually getting pre-existing stains out of the 10+ year old carpet with a lot of elbow grease, cleaner and a toothbrush. (My son has off work those days and can be here with me. I do not want to be alone with ### and/or his wife for any reason.)Unless they were lost, I did take a lot of photos when I moved in and will take a lot more on the 29th and 30th. Some things, like carpet stains, will be better than when I moved in, otherwise it's just five years of wear and tear. I'll keep you posted. Thank you again for everything.\n",
      "Hi again,Below is a draft of my walk through request. Please advise if this works.I'm thinking I should send the walk through request sometime this week via email. That gives me time to follow up with another email and then a mailed letter, and possibly a return receipt letter. When they fail to reply, that would give me just enough tme to send them notice that I left the keys in the kitchen on the 30th. I'm asking for the walk through on the 28th so I'd have two days for any extra work. I'm also hoping my son can accompany me on the 28th as I can no longer trust ### and his wife.The carpet cleaners are coming sometime on the 29th but they only give a call ###. Once that's ###e, I plan to fully document in photos how the carpet is actually cleaner than when I moved in (and have those pics as well.){fyi- I spoke to my therapist about recent events with ### and the neighbor. She thought they are both behaving ### and told me to avoid interacting with the neighbor at all costs. My son and I are doing are best to do just that for the next nine days of living here.}Thank you very much.Draft:Hello ###, As you know, I am moving out effective ###. I would like to schedule a walk through with you on ### at noon.

      "Yes, I will. I'd considered doing that and will give him two day/time options. I want to be reasonable even if others are not.Whether or not there's a walk through, I plan to ask him to meet me there on the 30th to return the keys. If he cannot or does not, I'll do as you advised and leave the keys on the kitchen counter, lock up best I can and email him what I did. I will send a letter by USPS mail the next day saying the same thing. Thank you very much.\n",

      "Hello,I have some questions about how clean is clean enough when I move out please?I plan to fill all nail holes I made because that's in the lease (###). I found filler that matches the wall color so ###'t need touch up paint. Is repainiting the walls normal wear and tear after five years, including one year of ###?The windows all have ### or drapes. The drapes are huge and would require soemone t climb up, take them down, remove clips and have them dry cleaned and then rehung. In my bedroom, I hung my own ### upon move in and will rehang their curtians before I leave. But, the rest are washable but again it's a big job and I do not see it in the lease. Is that my responsibility?The lease (###) says the range must be clean including the racks. It's a self cleaning, so I plan to run that and clean the rest manually. Racks cannot be cleaned during the self cleaning cycle or the finish gets ruined. My question is about the oven racks, which are dirty and look like they are more than ifive years old, mostly like they did when I moved in. Not sure if I took a photo of that in 2016. I plan to clean them outside with oven cleaner and a lot of scrubbing but no one could make them look new. I've priced two new oven racks which run $###. Do I just scrub them the best I can or do I have to spend $### $###? The entire old range is not worth $500. How clean is clean enough?Otherwise, I've scheduled a carpet cleaner for the 29th. Outside second floor window cleaners are scheduled for the 21st. Once we're moved out on the 15th, my son an I will clean the rest of the windows, kitchen, all appliances, bathrooms and closets and remove all trash and make sure it all looks good. We'll replace smoke detector batteries and all burnt out lightbulbs. I'm actually able to remove some pre-existing carpet stains with a new product, so carpets will be better than when I moved in. Depending on how the walk through and everything else plays out, I plan to ask ### to meet me here on the ###. I'll wait until a few days before the 30th to ask. If I get no reply or a refusal, I will leave the keys in the kitchen as you suggested and let him know what I did.I also plan to take lots of photos of everything. If I can, I will take videos of each appliance working. If there's anything else I should or shouldn't do, please let me know. I want to follow the lease and laws and do everything in my power to get my deposit back.Thank you very much.\n",
      "For the oven, you probably need to leave that at least as clean as it was as when you moved in.   If you can't document that the oven was dirty when you moved in, then you probably need to clean it, including the racks.   For racks that have years of baked-on grease, it helps to put them in a large, sturdy, unused trash bag after you've applied oven cleaner (or whatever other cleaning substance you're going to use).   Then seal the bag and let the racks sit overnight before you start scrubbing.   For the carpet, if it was new or clean when you moved in, you should have it cleaned before you move out (as you plan to do).  For the walls, ordinarily you wouldn't need to repaint or wash them unless they're badly ### or marked up.  For the window coverings, you probably don't need to have those cleaned unless they're  badly ### or have attract odors (like cigarette smoke).  Please keep in mind that my opinion -- or any lawyer's opinion -- isn't binding on your landlord or on a judge.   \n",
      "Thanks for the update.   I'm glad to hear that you found those oven pictures.\n",
      "I don't have a move-out inspection checklist to send or recommend.   Any piece of paper that lists each room/area on the premises and gives you a place to write down what the landlord wants you to do, if anything, for that room/area will do.   For example;Living room:   OKKitchen:   clean top of refrigeratorMaster bathroom:  OKMaster bedroom:   OKIf you can get the landlord to sign that list when you're done with the walk-through, fine.   If not, you still have your record of what he said you needed to do.   If he needs a copy of your list, he can take a picture with his phone.Your suggested reply to confirm 9:### 27th sounds fine.   You might want to mention that the carpet won't be cleaned until the 29th.\n",
      "Hi,I just got internet this morning. Whew! Nothing to report. My son and I are doing the final cleanup, other than the carpet cleaners, before the walk through on Tuesday. I was cleaning yesterday and saw ### out back at his garage for at least ###. A few minutes after I saw him leave, then he parked across the street from my 'old' house for another ###. His truck windows have dark ### so I couldn't see what he was doing. I did the oven racks once with oven cleaner in a trash bag overnight and lots of scrubbing. they do not look new, but better than when I moved in. I plan to do the process one more time, concentrating on the worst spots. I ran the self clean oven once but will run it agin and probably have to use oven cleaner on some missed spots. I'm replacing the electric burner plates with brand new. I used a dremel ### on the stovetop and underneath the burners. I will leave it as clean as humanly possible for a 10-###. Professional window cleaners did all the outside windows. He noted on the receipt that some of the window seals are leaking/missing/broken/etc. I cleaned all the inside windows but there is 'fogging' on all of them. It makes them look dirty but the dirt's between the panes so I cannot clean it without removing and diassembling the windows themselves which is unreasonable. I think they'll try to ding me for that somehow.I drafted a walk through form. Please tell me if this is okay:Walk through inspection ### ### 99517Area                                               Acceptable                          NoteLiving room/foyer/stairsDining areaKitchenLaundry room/ half bathUpstairs hall/closet/full bathroomMaster bedroom and ###/###Bedroom SW cornerBedroom NW cornerExteriorPlease note that professional carpet cleaners are scheduled for ###.Lessor:Lessee:Please let me know if this is okay.

      "Hi,Just to keep you posted, I started cleaning ### Street about ###. I got home about ###.I did another round of oven cleaner on the racks in garbage bags.  Then I spent about ###. Then I did a third round with oven cleaner in the bags. I got off 90-95% of the black ### but the racks themselves are just stained dark with age even when scrubbed clean. They are not ### ### and haven't been since I moved in. I'll take photos which show them better than I got them.I also spent an hour scrubbing the self-cleaning oven around the ### and the door and window, which the clean cycle didn't touch. There's dirt in between the glass panes on the oven window. I'm not supposed to dissamble the oven to clean that, am I? I don't know how. The inside of the oven is 95% clean which is the best I can do for a stove that's at least ten years old. The stovetop is clean other than black marks present when I moved in and I do have at least one photo of it.I spent the rest of the time scrubbing hard water stains in the two main bathrooms. We've used three or four heavy duty bathroom cleaners (###, CLR, and another brand I forget) and a Dremel power scrubbing tool but they need more work. I'm concerned because the tiles and grout are so old, when I scrub the stains, some of the grout is starting to come off, leaving gaps. I guess I'll just do the best I can to clean it.Hope you have a better Saturday than me! lol Thanks.\n",
      "Yes, I agree. Thanks again.\n",
      "Hello,Today, my son and I spent about three hours at the old place for the carpet cleaner and to finish our task list from ###. The carpet cleaner noted on the receipt that there are areas of carpet that need restretching.We finished everything on the list with ###-###. As soon as we arrived, I had my son video me pouring ### into a spray bottle and spraying it in the two corners ### asked me to. It sat 30-###. I resprayed it and checked again about an hour later and still nothing changed. I use a toothbrush in the two small spots but nothing changed. I had already tried this ###-###. I had also used ###, CLR and Lime Away on it with no change. I sprayed it for a third time and scrubbed but still nothing changed. What would be a reasonable amount for them to withhold for that? I'm thinking not more than $###.The second thing is that we did remove the glass globes from the ###970's light fixtures and cleaned them as ### asked. But, when we tried to put them back up, we couldn't figure out how to secure them in the base. They would stay put but were not at all secure and would all fall and break with the next earth ###. So, I left them (clean and ###) on the kitchen counter with a note saying we were afraid they'd break if we left them perched so loosely up there. There's six of them. I left some extra new light bulbs for the inconvenience.Tomorrow I will email ### about everything else we did accomplish and explain the above. I'll also let him know about the keys in that email. I welcome any advice or suggestions. Thanks again.\n",
      "I agree. Thanks for making me feel better about it. I'm up at ###. I will check later today but I might have a photo of the shower from when I moved in. The same black spots were there in 2016, so hopefully I can find it. If I find it, I can send it to him if he dings me for it. Sorry I forgot to write that earlier. I'm totally exhausted  and it's hard to think at this point. I'll send the email to ### later today. Thanks again.\n",
      "I'm charging my old phone to see if I have shower photos from 2016. Once I determine that, I'll finish my draft email to ###.Formatting in the draft is messed up but my email will be correct. Please let me know what you think about the content. Thank you.         Here's the draft so far:###, I wanted you to know we've ###e everything on the list from our walk through. The carpets were professionally cleaned yesterday. All remaining items were removed and the patio was swept, the NW corner bedroom smoke detector had a new battery put in and was replaced on ceiling, air vent at top of stairs was ### and vacuumed, the fireplace was vacuumed, two corners of master bath shower were rebleached and scrubbed three more times, light globes at top of stairs and dining room removed and cleaned.  Thank you for agreeing to take care of the bulb and globe on the foyer light fixture. We couldn't figure out how to access it. I left you four of the smaller bulbs for that fixture even though only one as burnt out. When we removed the light globes from the top of the stairs and the dining room for cleaning, we could not figure out how to replace them in a secure way. The globes would just sit, perched precariously, on top of the base. They would just fall off if we left them like that. I didn't want that to happen, so I left those six clean globes on the kitchen counter with a note. I also left a box of regular light bulbs for you. I know you said you have a supply of replacement light globes, but couldnâ€™t in good conscience leave the globe unsecured and barely balanced on the bases. I resprayed undiluted ### bleach on the two bottom corners of the master shower three times yesterday. I scrubbed with a toothbrush and resprayed. Those areas did not change in any way. Over the last few weeks, I had previously cleaned them with undiluted ### bleach, Kabooom, CLR, Lime Away and Barkeepers Friend scouring powder. I also use a Dremel power ### in those spots. Nothing I did changed the dark spots in any way. Note to ### for photos on old phone??                The property has been left in good order, normal wear and                 tear excepted. The thermostat is set at ###.  We will leave the keys on the kitchen counter later tonight. They will be there by ###. The front door will be locked on the doorknob only as a key is required to lock the deadbolt from outside.  My new address is ### 45th Ave Unit B Anchorage AK 99517.

      "How's this reply I drafted? I have to wait for my son's help with sending photos and hope to do so over the weekend when he has time off from ###. Please let me know  what you think. Thank you very much.###,In response to your email:###. The fireplace was cleaned both before and after the walk through on ###. During the walk through, you asked me to ### the ashes from the corners of the ###. I had already thoroughly swept the ### to remove the ashes. On ###, per your request, I ###ed the ###, paying particular attention to the corners as you asked. I took before and after photos. I kept the ### cleaner I used, still containing the ###/###.###. The carpet had numerous stains and spots when I moved in. There were and are a number of areas of carpet that need to be re-stretched, including the area in question in the southwest bedroom. The carpet in this home is over ten years old. In any rental unit, this is normal wear and tear and the landlord's responsibility to repair or replace. Replacing very old, damaged carpet is not my responsibility. It was professionally cleaned per our lease agreement and a copy of the receipt mailed to your post office box. Re-stretching or replacing ten year old or older carpet with brand new carpeting is the landlord's responsibility. ###. Power washing the back yard and mold removal on the outside of your property are not in our lease. It is not on the walk through form. Regarding the patio (which I assume is what you mean when you say backyard) the form says to remove my items including trash and sweep the patio. All of those things were completed. If you recall, you previously told me you pl###d to rebuild the patio deck, replace some boards, power wash everything, etc. That was the day you had a strange man enter my patio and I called the police, thinking he was an intruder. Power washing is not something you can withhold any portion of my security deposit for this.###. As I told you during the walk through, the shower had black areas when I moved in. I will forward photo to you. I also have documentation that I did re-bleach this area as you requested during the walk through. I resprayed undiluted ### bleach on the bottom corner of the master shower three times after the walk through. I scrubbed with a toothbrush and resprayed. Those areas did not change in any way. Over the last few weeks, I had previously cleaned it with undiluted ### bleach, ###, CLR, Lime Away and Barkeepers Friend scouring powder. I also use a Dremel power ### in those spots. Nothing I did changed the dark spots in any way.  5. I will mail a copy of the carpet cleaning receipt to your post office box. To reiterate, I have documentation of everything I have stated. I will forward to you the pertinent photos or other documentation regarding the ### and shower within the next few days and notify you by email when it is completed.   I will not return to do anything else because everything that I am responsible for plus all the extra tasks you asked me to perform, and everything I'm required to do by our lease and the law have been completed. Any other work you wish to have ###e is your responsibility. To reiterate, I have documentation of everything I have stated.  I will forward to you the pertinent photos or other documentation regarding the ### and shower within the next few days and notify you by email and/or text when completed.  Once I have sent that email, I expect an immediate return of my full security deposit of $###,650.00.### ###\n",

      "Hi,I got a fat envelope from ### in the mail today. It contained a check for $###,350.00. There are eight pages, a letter, a landlord's security deposit offset statement and copies of photos. There's also a new issue there that I need to ask you about .He is withholding $###, not power washing ### off the patio, carpet stains, the shower, fireplace etc. He also added things not mentioned on the walk thru form such as an outside light fixture that was damaged by a ###, a tiny crack in a dropped ceiling light panel and a ding in the sink, both caused by the earthquake in ###, etc. He's also confusing vacuuming ashes from the ### versus having the entire chimney cleaned and inspected. I used to own a chimney sweep business, was professionally trained, ### certified, and a member of the National Chimney Sweep Guild many years ago so I know what I'm talking about. He is clueless.  He's charging me $###. I paid $###. The windows are '###' with dirt and ### in between the double panes. They are the original windows from the ###. He did not write much of this on the walk through form or tell me about it in any way until now.I noticed he did not include any photos of how things looked when I moved in back in 20###6. His letter had a ### tone and he outright lied more than once.I do not think I am responsible for anything he claims and have at least some proof of almost everything, including a lot of other parts of the house that were dirty when I moved in, with date stamps. The check has something written on it like, 'deposit refund' and 'pd in full.' I'm not going to deposit the check yet.Should I accept the $###,### $### $###? I've gone to small claims three or four times as pro se before and successful most times so it's not that big of a deal to me. I'm willing to do it if there's more than a 50% chance of winning. I know he does NOT have much free time on his hands and that they like to travel Outside a lot as well. So, that might be to my advantage, as well as the new issue below. I can prove the vast majority of my claims and also have documentation of how he ignores laws and rules, even police papers about him telling a contractor (to power wash the patio and rebuild the deck) to enter my private patio for measuring without telling me and I called the police on him.I can make copies of ###'s letter and check and mail them to you since my printer is not yet connected to my computer. My son can't do that connection until Wednesday or Thursday. Or I can wait until he does that (with no guarantees lol). Please let me know and I can mail it on Monday.The 'new' issue with the old place is something I discovered while looking through old photos of the home on my phones for the proof ### wanted. I noticed what I thought was a cable going from the back of the old house, along the fence, and into ###'s separate garage building. There is also an outside electrical ### on ###'s garage outside wall. You can see a metal chimney coming out the garage roof and I remember seeing smoke/exhaust/something coming out of it from time to time.I contacted the electric company who said there is only one meter on the property but when I explained why, the guy laughed and said that's between you and the landlord and hung up. I contacted the gas company who said there are not two separate meters for the home and garage, it's all the same meter and that is gas was used in the garage, I was being billed for it. (I'm assuming the same with electric.) When I asked more questions by email, they wanted the address and it worried me. I didn't know what to do so I didn't reply. I ###'t know if there was theft of services going on or exactly how to find out. Should I pursue it with the gas company or ask ### to explain it first?I remember when I first moved in, the gas and electric bills seemed high. After a year or two, I asked ### who laughed it off saying bills are high in ###, but after that those bills seemed to both go down. I might be able to obtain those bills. I won't do anything until I hear from you.Thank you very much.\n",
      "p.s. To save time and so as not to miss my mail today, I made copies of the above for you and put them in my mailbox this morning. I copied everything ### sent me (his pics were color, sorry) including a copy of the check. There is nothing on the back of the check. Also included is a copy of the walk thru form he signed. Thanks again.\n",
      "I plan to do nothing until I hear more from you. I do not need to cash the check and will hold on to it for now. My mail carrier picked up the copies on Monday morning, so hopefully you receive them soon. I'll wait to hear from you. Thank you very much.\n",
      "I agree that $###'t worth the hassle if you don't absolutely need that money to pay rent or put food on the table.  Yes, we can leave this matter open until the check clears.\n",
      "Hello,I just got a call from my Carpet Cleaner. She said the old landlord wants them to send him a copy of my invoice. I have already sent him that. I told that to the carpet cleaners and said not to give him anything because it's none of his business plus he got it already from me. She said that's why she called to ask me because I was their customer, not him.She said ### told her he wants them to come back and repair damaged carpet. She told him no because it's been over a month. It sounds like he wanted them to replace his very old carpet for free. She said the landlord's wife also told her they've been doing a lot of work in there. So both ### and his wife have called my carpet cleaners trying to get info and freebies. I told the carpet cleaner a little about ### so she knows who she's dealing with. She said she knows this type of landlord and will ignore him from now on.As soon as my son can take me later today, I'm going to deposit the check and hope they haven't put a stop on it. I'll keep you posted.Thank you.\n",
      "Hello,I called my credit union and confirmed the $###. YAY!!!!! Does that mean I'm done with the old landlord once and for all?Have a great weekend. I plan to! lol Thank you.\n",
      "I can't think of anything more your old landlord needs to do about you or anything more you need to do about him (assuming you're at peace with the decision not to fight with him over the deduction from your security deposit).   Having said that, let me add that I don't control what your landlord does.   But, it looks like both of you have tied up all of the loose ends and that he should now be out of your life.I'm sorry you've had such a terrible experience wrapping up your old lease.   Part of the problem may have been that your landlord and his wife didn't agree on things, so he told you one thing and then gave you a different answer after his wife overruled his original decision.I wish you peace and ### and all things good in your new home!### B.\n",
      "Yes, I'm happy with the $###. I'm ecstatic to have him and his wife out of my life. Should we keep this open for a little while in case something happens or do you think it's safe to close it? I can't tell you how much I appreciate all your time and effort to help me. I probably would have ma de some bad decisions along the way without your help.  I'm forever grateful. Thank you. ### ###\n",
      "Hello,Not sure that it matters now, but here's an update. On my way home from the store early this morning, the same store I shopped at before I moved, I wasn't thinking and headed home, but to the old place. I realized when I was about three blocks away so I drove by the old place since I had to turn off the main road to turn around. I saw a For Rent sign in the front yard and a lock box on the front door knob. It was a generic homemade looking sign with no company name. There were flyers on the sign but I didn't park and take one. I did take a photo of the yard with sign and front door.I guess he either lied or changed his mind about moving into that home like he told me. I've also seen and heard a motorcycle drive by my new home at least five or six times. It looks very much like the old landlord's bike with him riding it. I can't be sure because he wears a helmet. The bike revs really loud and sounds like his but I can't be sure or do anything about it.I feel sorry for the new tenants but am glad to be away from these people. I plan to box up all the paperwork and other documentation and evidence I have about them and store it until the statute of limitations runs out, then hopefully burn it! lolThank you.\n",
      "Nice place -- too bad it came with a ### landlord!I hope you're settled into your new home and are enjoying summer.\n",

      "Good morning, I currently live in anchorage and I wanted to know how to go about getting some previous charges removed from courtview or if that is even an option? Back in ###, class A misdemeanor, commit abuse child/vulnerable adult which was DV related, case ### 3AN-1-09673CR. For my agreement I had ###. I would like to have all of that removed or at least the charge that was dismissed by the prosecution, because that has really limited me as far the jobs that I want. I honestly am not that kind of person and I feel like that I do get quite a bit of judgement due to what courtveiw says. I feel like if I can get both removed I do have a better chance at getting the jobs that I want and not be judged for an incident that happened in the past. I would greatly appreciate a point in the right direction to get these going, thank you very much for your time and have a good day.Tenesha \n",

      "a dissolution is an option if both parties agree on the issues of property division and child custody. Their are forms for this on the court website and it is filed jointly by both parties.

      "Hello ###,I really appreciate your expedited and thorough response. My financial situation is not that good. I got divorced ###. Pretty much all of my credit cards are maxed out although I have been paying on some of them. I live paycheck to paycheck so itâ€™s even more scary for me in that respect. Im not denying that I owe BOA money, I just donâ€™t have the means to pay and thatâ€™s why I wasnâ€™t making payments to begin with because theyâ€™re minimum payment was astronomical. I was trying to focus on having a roof over my head, a vehicle to get to work, and food. So I honestly was just focusing on that. Now they want $###. As far as how old the debt is itâ€™s definitely a few months but ill have to find out just exactly how much somehow. Id be willing to set up a payment plan with them if itâ€™s an option but it would have to be small amounts at a time. Iâ€™ve been trying to get into ### ### and his financial peace information to better myself but then I was hit with this. I just donâ€™t know what to do. Please advise, anything you can offer would be greatly appreciated. I also signed up for the ###, and was hoping to call and speak with someone through the ### Bar Association via phone to elaborate or clarify, but Iâ€™m so glad you got to me sooner. Warm Regards,### Patufka \n",
      "Please keep your appointment with the MLK Day legal clinic tomorrow.   You'll probably be able to discuss your situation in more detail there than we can here, and that may enable the person who's helping you at that event give you more advice than I can give you here.   Plus, three heads are often better than two!You mentioned that your recent priorities have been keeping a roof over your head, a vehicle to get to work, and food on the table.  That sounds like a pretty ### set of priorities.   I hope you're taking care of health and well-being, too, since it's harder to tackle life's problems if you're not taking care of yourself.  If Bank of America is not your only financial problem, then you may want to get some advice about whether to file bankruptcy.   You probably wouldn't want to file for a $###,###, but if, on top of the BoA debt, you have several maxed-out credit cards that you're struggling to pay plus a pile of debt left over from your marriage, bankruptcy might be the best solution.  You mentioned the ### ### program.   It's good that you're thinking about how to turn things around, although I don't know whether that program is the right fit for you at this time.   Also, you've probably been scouring the internet for help, so please be wary of any financial-advice or financial-assistance program that promises to get you debt-free, at least if the advice or program costs you more than the price of a paperback book.   There are a great many plans, schemes, and outright frauds out there, most of which aren't likely to be of much help and some of which can actually hurt.Finally, Bank of America's lawsuit will not make you pay the entire $###,500(ish) amount now.  All that Bank of America can get from the court is a piece of paper saying that you owe them money.   The court is not going to take the money from you; Bank of America has to use court-supervised procedures to try to collect.   The hard truth (for banks) is that most people, probably including you, don't have much that a judgment creditor (like BoAP) can seize to pay a court judgment.   BoA can get ###% of your PFD (assuming you get a PFD and no one has beat BoA to it).   BoA can try to seize money in your bank account(s), but there are ways you can protect yourself against that.   BoA can try to garnish your wages (although they don't typically do that), but most or perhaps all of your paycheck is protected against garnishment if you're making the amount of money that makes you eligible to post questions on this website.   BoA won't take your car or jewelry or pets or pretty much anything else you own because that stuff is either protected against court judgments or isn't, from the bank's perspective, worth the cost of trying to track it down and take it from you.  \n",
      "Thank you for your kind words, Iâ€™m still learning as I go along and am just trying my best in everything I do.

With the bankruptcy, what would the long ###/short ### repercussions be should I take that route? If I do choose that route would it make sense to answer acknowledging that I do in fact owe them money and would like to set up a payment plan ? Or should I talk to someone regarding bankruptcy first? I just never thought it would come down to this that at ###. Itâ€™s ###, I mean even if they could take things from me it wouldnâ€™t ### to $3500(ish). I will definitely call the MLK legal clinic tomorrow to inquire about the bankruptcy piece. \n",
      "Unfortunately the answer is probably not, unless such a requirement is included in a court order or court approved parenting plan.  You could however seek to amend your parenting plan and/or ask the court to modify the court order and based on what you have stated you would have a fair chance of success.  Have you asked him to do so voluntarily?  That would be the best starting point and you can point out that if he does not agree, or at least come to some compromise, that you will file something in court and it might not look good for him.  This kind of issue if well suited for mediation in my experience, and if you qualify financially you might be able to get the court to pay for the mediation.  Good luck.\n",
      "Hi, Christopher --I'm sorry to hear that the divorce/custody case didn't come out the way you wanted.Is your case number 4BE-18-00415CI  (filed by Kristy Alstrom in Bethel)?   If so, the deadline for filing an appeal has probably already passed. Usually, the deadline for filing an appeal is ###.   I can't tell from looking at Courtview (the court's online database) exactly when the court distributed the divorce decree and related documents in your case, but that probably happened at the time of, or not long after, the court docketed the decree and related documents ###.   So, your appeal deadline was probably sometime in May or June of last year.  Sometimes the Alaska Supreme Court will accept a late-filed appeal.   If you believed you had a year to file an appeal, instead of only ###, you can file a motion that asks the Supreme Court to let you file a late appeal.  The Supreme Court has discretion to grant or deny a motion to allow a late-filed appeal.  The 1-year limit that you know about probably is the 1-year deadline under Civil Rule 60(b) to modify or set aside a judgment.   You still have time to file a 60(b) motion (although the Courtview docket suggests that you already tried that, and the judge ruled against you).  You may also have another option, if the decision you want to challenge involves custody or child support.   The trial judge has authority to modify a decision about custody or child support if circumstances have materially changed since the judge made the original decision.    Gail B.  \n",
      "###, good morning. This is a somewhat surprising outcome. I expect that the court allowed the hearing to go forward despite you not receiving service of process because you appeared in the hearing. Did the court have a copy of your declaration? Regardless, as I think we discussed on the phone, it's possible the federal moratorium may not have applied which would render the declaration essentially useless. I'm guessing that is the case here, and the reason the court relied on state law. The eviction statutes are fairly clear that you need to receive notice before you can be evicted. I think it's important to understand what the court said about what/how/when you received that notice. At this point you need some ### assistance that, unfortunately, I am unable to provide on this forum. I recommend calling ### Legal Services:###. They will probably tell you to fill out the two-page application, here: https://www.alsc-law.org/wp-content/uploads/20###-app-ANC.pdf. I recommend telling them you received limited assistance at MLK Day and on ABA Free Legal Answers, and that we recommended you call them, that you require some additional urgent assistance, as an eviction was entered yesterday for non-payment of rent despite your COVID-related hardship and likely faulty notice. In addition, there is an attorney-staffed landlord tenant hotline TONIGHT from 6-###. I recommend calling around 5:###: ###. My other advice is more practical in nature: I think you should start looking for alternate housing - a friend, family member, co-worker - in case the eviction is permitted to go forward. I'm very sorry about this situation, my very best wishes to you.### P.S. Attached are two publications from the AK Courts, one on landlord tenant issues generally, another, more specific, on evictions. They are helpful resources that will supplement your knowledge and the assistance you receive going forward. Thanks again and best wishes.\n",
      "You need to be able to convince the judge with a preponderance of evidence that there has been a substantial change in circumstances since the original court order to justify a change in the custody order to grant you what you want.  The burden on you is fairly high, and many judges do not like to change  their minds once they issue an initial order, but if things are as bad as you say and you can prove it to the court you should be able to succeed.  The more witnesses, documents, emails, neutral reports, expert opinions, and other evidence that you have the better your chances should be.  If you cannot afford an attorney, or qualify for a pro bono attorney through ### Legal Services or possibly through one of the domestic violence centers, you can proceed on your own with the forms from the court system's Self Help Center.  If you have trouble understanding the forms, you should find a friend or other advocate with some legal experience to help you.   I usually recommend mediation if possible to people contemplating family law and most other legal proceedings. Mediation does not always work but when it does work, which is about ###% of the time, it is faster, less expensive, less traumatic and more satisfactory in the long run that the traditional litigation process. If domestic violence is involved mediation should only be done with a mediator trained in its dynamics, and possibly using special protocols. I hope Iâ€™ve provided the information you were seeking. Good luck and if you need more help, please let me know so l can continue to assist you.  \n",

I just donâ€™t know how to do that without paying a lawyer to help me and I really canâ€™t afford that. Iâ€™ve researched a â€œstepparent adoptionâ€ and termination of rights for absent parent and Iâ€™ve thought that would be the best place to start but I donâ€™t know what forms to fill out or if this would be the best route.

Another thing to note is my husband is military and we will be moving out of ### in ######3, so I want to try to resolve this before then. Iâ€™d rather not just file for full custody because I have no way of locating the biological father or getting an address to serve him papers, he moves around a lot, stays with people, and doesnâ€™t always have a residency. The court clerk said that would be my responsibility to locate him and serve him. Iâ€™m afraid of it taking years to get this taken care of and then ### be stuck in ### with an open case when we are supposed to be moving. ###s biological father did say he would sign his rights away on his own multiple times before he changed his number and blocked me out.

Does he have to be in the state of ### to sign his rights over or can he be out of state and do so? Do I have be in ### to resolve this? Please let me know what you think would be the best legal route to take in my situation. If I you have other suggestions I would love to hear them. Thank you for your time -###\n",

There has been a custody hearing that keeps getting postponed due to the fact that they are Native American, and the Tribe with which they are enrolled (Passamaquoddy Tribe, Pleasant Point, ME) does not cooperate or participate with the courts in ###.  I have tried to complete the laundry list of items that ### has giving me, but some of the things are impossible to get done where I have lived, Chignik Bay, AK.

Since the State of ### will not give me custody of my biological children (I have never been in trouble with the law, I don't use drugs including marijuana or consume alcohol), and the Tribe with which they are enrolled in refuses to take action, is it possible for me to voluntarily terminate my parental rights?

      "Unfortunately there is no simple answer to  your question.  Each case and each judge is different.  They should be listening to the preferences of kids at tby the time they are ### 14.  But many judges remain reluctant to involve the children because they think it will further ### them.  I would suggest that you first of all decide exactly what it is that you wand the judge to order differently, since the judges often do not know what they can do to make things better.  Be reasonable and do not ask for too much, but only things that you can justify as in the children's best interest. and that will really work.  And in your factual basis for your request make particular emphasis on the views of the children and the harm they are currently experiencing and ask that they be interviewed, either by the judge him or herself or a custody investigator or another agent of the court.  And be ready to rebut the charges of your ex with evidence other than just testimony, such as nasty texts, emails, school reports, or the like.

      "How can I get my aunt to pay me my trust or who enforces the trust?\n",
      "Hi, ### --The answers to your questions depend a lot on what the trust says.   If the trust document says you are entitled to trust money now, no strings attached, and your aunt (presumably the trustee) won't release the money to you, then theoretically you can file a lawsuit to enforce the trust (unless the trust requires some other way to resolve disputes, like arbitration).   Whether it's wise to do that depends on a lot of things, including how much money is involved, how much you care about preserving family relationships, and whether there's any issue of the trust being mismanaged.But:If the trust document ties up your money until you reach a certain age and you're not there yet, there's probably not a lot you can do.If the trust document authorizes distributions for specific purposes (schooling, housing, etc.) and you want to spend the trust money some other way,  there's probably not a lot you can do.If the trust document gives your aunt discretion about when to make distributions, and for what purposes, and she decided not to make a distribution that you want, there's probably not a lot you can do.  ### B.\n",

I went to the bank to try to refinance the car over to my name; but when the bank contact him they said he already trade in the car & that he doesnâ€™t have it anymore.

      "Hi Amy,I am sorry to hear that you are having a hard time with your child's father's new partner. Just so you know, typically, in protective order cases for stalking, you have to demonstrate that the respondent is engaging in nonconsensual contact.  There are very specific definitions of this outlined in AS 11.41.270.  You can find the information here: http://www.touchngo.com/lglcntr/akstats/Statutes/Title11/Chapter41/Section270.htm. At the long-term hearing, you will need to bring these things up and explain how the factors are pertinent to your case.With regard to custody, the court is going to consider the best interest factors identified in AS 25.24.150(c) - also here: http://www.touchngo.com/lglcntr/akstats/statutes/title25/chapter24/section150.htm. If you do a modification request, you will need to be able to demonstrate that there has been a substantial change in circumstance that affects the children's welfare. Without that, the Court is not likely to change things. That being said, you will need to show the court more than your unhappiness with your ex's new spouse. It needs to tie into how it affects the children. The Court is not big on controlling who a parent can date or be in a relationship with unless it causes issues with the children's health, safety or welfare. Another option is to file an uncontested modification to custody in which you both agree to not have the children around this woman.\n",
      "Hello ###,The remedy for a party failing to comply with a visitation order is to file a Motion for an Order to Show Cause. It sounds like you've gone through this before - please tell me if that is the case. Still, it is the appropriate move. After finding that the opposing party has once again failed to comply, the judge will be less lenient and more likely to look for additional accommodations such as a modification to the custody order so that you have more time with your children. For example, you could request that you no longer alternate breaks; that the children spend all breaks with you. The idea that there is something for the opposing party to lose in the case may motivate her toward compliance.I've included some links below for your reference. The first is the Motion & Affidavit to Enforce Order. The other is the Family Law Self Help Center. I have a feeling you may have spent a lot of time with these resources already and I apologize if I am telling you things you already know. Remember, you need to have the affidavit notarized and mail it to the opposing party or have it served by a process server. You will also need to file a Proposed Order along with your Motion. That form, along with the Notice of Motion can be found under the section What forms can I use to ask the court to enforce an order?\" All of these forms should be filed with the court and served on the opposing party - mail is probably easiest.Motion and Affidavit:http://www.courts.alaska.gov/shc/family/docs/shc-1540n.pdfFamily law resources:http://courts.alaska.gov/shc/family/shcenforce.htmI know this process is receptive and can be frustrating. Feel free to follow up with additional questions.Will ###\"\n",
      "Motion for an Order to Show to Cause is another name for a Motion to Enforce Order. So, yeah I am basically telling to follow the same process. I hope that the judge will make expectations more clear as a pattern emerges.As for service, if it's really a big concern it may be worth it to hire a private process server. You can just look up that up on the Internet. I certainly don't have any recommendations for someone in ###.I wish you the best of luck with this. I am going to close out the question for now, but obviously feel free to come back as the situation develops.Will ###\n",

      "Yeah, thatâ€™s why I said Iâ€™d focus more on the other reasons not just for failure to pay esp because even if the court says okay, he needs a proper declaration, they can put it on hold anyway if he turns one in (sounds like he has, even though he lied). Process servers arenâ€™t required. Check that link out that I sent you or even look here at the self help website: http://courts.alaska.gov/shc/family/serve.htm#11Heck, even as a private practice lawyer I donâ€™t use process servers if we can avoid them because they are so expensive for the client. We always us US mail. It can be certified but the rules donâ€™t require it once the case has started. I wouldnâ€™t bother taping it and taking photos. Thatâ€™s just a whole lot of your time wasted. Serve it the normal way through the mail and call it good. Just make sure you put â€œmailed via first class mailâ€ as the certificate of service method. And you can always email it to him too.

      "Hi, ### --I'm sorry to hear that the car sale has created such a hassle for you.You asked about how much attorney's fees you could recover from the buyer if you win in court.   The answer is:  It depends.  First, it depends on what your contract says (if there is a written contract).   A typical car sale contract would include a provision saying that, if the parties end up in court and the buyer loses, the buyer has to pay all of the seller's reasonable attorney's fees.   But, maybe your contract doesn't say that (or maybe you don't have a written contract at all).  Second, it depends on whether any of the claims in the lawsuit are based on a statute that provides for an award of attorney's fees (not likely in a car sale case).Third, it depends on what you win.  A money judgment against the buyer?  A court order saying that you get to keep the repossessed car but that the buyer doesn't owe you any more money?  Something else?   There is a court rule (Rule ###) that explains how attorney's fees are awarded in various circumstances.   You can find that rule at this link:  https://public.courts.alaska.gov/web/rules/docs/civ.pdf    If you win and your situation is governed by the court rule, you probably can get a money judgment against the buyer for a small part of your legal fees (assuming you are represented by a lawyer in court).   The rest of your legal fees, you'll eat.  And, even if the court awards you some attorney fees, all you'll get is a piece of paper -- a money judgment -- saying that the buyer owes you money.  The court won't collect that judgment for you.   You will have to collect it yourself, at your expense (although there are some ### expenses that you can add on).   There's no guarantee that the buyer will have anything that you can get to with a judgment, except perhaps part of his PFD (assuming he gets a PFD and that no other creditor has beaten you to it and that you want to spend some money to chase part of his PFD).    And, the buyer probably can discharge (get rid of) your judgment by filing bankruptcy.The rule on attorney fees works both ways, so if the buyer wins in court, he probably can get a money judgment against you for at least part of his attorney fees.  Unless you sold a really valuable car, there's probably not enough money at stake here for either of you spend money on lawyer fees to fight over the car in court.  ### B.\n",

The ### Court System has a Family Law self help center that is devoted to helping people file for divorce and custody orders on their own. Not sure what your marital status is with the father. If you are married, then each parent has a right to custody. If you divorce, custody is also addressed in the order. If you are unmarried you would need to file for a custody order to assure that you have the physical custody and all decision making rights.

      "Dear Ms. Birchard:Your uncle could have made a rent to own agreement with you. I would need to see the actual agreement in order to ascertain what the obligations of you and he were. In general, however, if you are paying rent toward ownership, you are still required to make your rental payments on time. As a tenant, you are entitled to have your land### maintain the premises - and means provide a proper boiler. If you have been served with a Notice to Quit for Non Payment of Rent, that is preparation for a Forcible Entry and Detainer lawsuit against you (an Eviction). The Notice should have given you a number of days within which you should pay up any past due rent or be evicted. It would be in your best interest to pay the past due rent and then pursue your rights to have the boiler fixed.If you are unable to do that, then when you are served with the lawsuit Complaint, you may counterclaim two things: ###) that you have an ownership interest in the property. Generally the district court cannot hear those cases and they are removed to the Superior Court to determine whether there you have an interest in the property, depending upon the facts of the case. In some cases, the district court can make determinations about ownership but that court is generally limited in that it does not have the jurisdiction to decide real property rights. ###) you could also counterclaim that you do not owe the whole sum of rent because the boiler is out of order. It would be important to document that by having someone come and give you an estimate of what it would cost to repair. You also should have made a written demand for repair. Without seeing the entire agreement that you and your Uncle made, it is not possible for me to fully advise you. I am going to attach here the Evictions Handbook and the Land ### Tenant Handbook that the ### Court System has on its website. It will not answer your questions about the rent to own part of your question, but it should address your rights as a tenant and your rights to have the land### maintain a fit premises. If you can find a way to send your rent to own contract, I will leave this question open for you to do so. Best, SR\n",
      "Dear Ms. Birchard:I do not see that what you send shows any rent to purchase agreement. There are a lot of back and forth around paying and fixing things, but the agreement is unclear. Maybe you have the agreement rent to own somewhere else. If you did not receive a legally sufficient Notice to Quit (as referenced in the Forcible Entry and Detainer Handbook, then you are right that the court will not hear the eviction case. However, the court will likely not dismiss the case, but will give your Aunt additional time to re-notice you legally. I am not certain of the dates that one can claim Covid protection from eviction. I believe you are correct that it extends currently through ###.Here is the ### Order:https://www.###.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/more/pdf/###-Eviction-Moratorium-03292021.pdfTo claim this protection, you must be qualified to do so by your circumstances. I have attached the documents an you can review them to see if you qualify. If so, that could extend the time you have.Texts are indeed evidence and can be admitted in any court hearing. I do not believe that a counterclaim for stress or hardship will result in anything. If you have been unable to pay your rent for any reason, that is problematic. Courts will see that as stressful to the landlord. Some courts require that even if you have an offsetting claim for having to make repairs, that you are required to post the rent with the court to show good faith that you actually have the rent to pay and that you are not just trying to fudge a way not to pay. The defense to your non payment of rent could be that you bought and paid for all the items and repairs made that were the landlord's responsibility. You can also counterclaim for anything you paid over the amount of past due rent. However, to do this you will need receipts for the work that you had done as well as proof that you paid your rent for those months that you also paid for repairs. Unless you have a document that clearly says that your rental payments were also payments toward ownership of the home, then I think that you are out of luck on making that argument. If you have such a document, then your counterclaim would be that you have an real property interest that the court will have to consider. It is impossible to predict the result of that. \n",
      "A few references to mortgage payment or house payment is insufficient alone to establish an agreement to purchase real property through applying your rent to the purchase. Having utilities in your name is not unusual for a landlord/tenant agreement. Landlords often require that utlities be paid separate from rent and that the utilities are in the tenants name. If there is no agreement in writing, this places you at an extreme disadvantage. Agreements to purchase real estate have to be in writing. I think at this point what you will be arguing about is whether you have overpaid the rent and whether she can evict you based on non payment of rent. What is the monthly rent supposed to be separate and apart from the utilities? I think the court would hold you responsible for the rent and the utilities (because if they are in your name, it would appear you accepted payment for utilities when you put them in your name).  Anything you paid for repairs over and above this could be offset to the rent due. SR\n"

      "Hi Sarah,I am sorry you are having to deal with this. It sounds like your ex-husband is making life difficult for you and your daughter. I would suggest considering a couple things. First, you ex-husband will be able to pursue visitation through the court (essentially anyone can ask the court to do anything), but this does not mean he will be successful. There are a variety of things you can do to help make sure he is not successful, including potentially showing up at court to explain what you have explained here as to why he should not get visitation. If your ex is entering your home even though you had him ### from the property, I would suggest reaching out to the police again regarding his repeated trespassing. You mentioned he took $###,###. I would also consider reporting this to the police and/or filing a police report about this incident. The reason its important to report the theft and the trespassing is because this establishes a written record of what your ex is doing that you can use to argue to a court in a visitation hearing that your ex should not be able to modify the custody order.The next thing that I would consider doing is filing for a protective order against your ex. If you obtained this, it would be a court order telling you ex he cannot continue to harass you and your daughter or enter your home. There are several resources you can look to to figure out how to file for an order.  Here is a link to where you petition for a protective order Domestic Violence, Stalking or Sexual Assault - ### Court System and here is a link that explains the process DV Protection Orders - ### Court System. The ### Court System's family law self help center is also a great resource for learning about the process (### Court System - Family Law Self-Help Center or call ###-### or ###).

      "Hello, thank you for taking your time to read my question today. The noncustodial parent (### call him ZD) is saying heâ€™s going to summon me back to court because heâ€™s â€œdone paying child support.â€ Heres a short backstory and a little info, last year I filed for custody to be finalized. ZD never bothered to respond to the custody papers so by default I got to pick custody. I have my daughter weekdays and the very last weekend of every month. He has her 1st, 2nd, and 3rd weekend. Around the same time I was filing custody, I was granted a short ### restraining order against him. Well throughout this year heâ€™s been constantly picking her up late, or leave her with me all together. He doesnâ€™t care to spend any holidays with her (he had her Fatherâ€™s Day ### ### ### 9am.) ZD contacted me ### asking if I could keep her ###th, 5th, and 6th for his â€œbirthday weekendâ€ I was dumb and said yes. Anytime I say no he gets verbally and mentally abusive. It has gotten so hard to coparent with him, now heâ€™s claiming heâ€™s taking my daughter because heâ€™s â€œdone paying child supportâ€. ZD can barely handle his weekends I donâ€™t know why he thinks he can take more custody from me. I guess my question is, how would it be possible for him to take more custody from me? And how to I vocalize to the court that ZD canâ€™t handle more custody because he can barely handle her on the weekends? And in what circumstances can he get out of paying child support?My main concern is him claiming heâ€™s taking custody from me because heâ€™s â€œdone paying child supportâ€ when he never cared to answer the custody paperwork in the first place... thank you so much for your help today.\n",

While you are not guaranteed an attorney in a proceeding like this, there are several options you might consider. The first option would be attending the hearing self represented after reviewing the materials provided by the ### Court System's Family Law self help center (link here: ### Court System - Family Law Self-Help Center) or you can call them at ### or ###. You'll see various links to videos and other resources that explain the restraining order process and what to expect at a court hearing.

There are several options if you want to talk to someone, but given how soon your hearing is, I encourage you to try to call tomorrow to hopefully reach someone. One option is to call AWARE (AWARE (awareak.org)); their hotline number is ###-### or ######. You'll need to be sure to ask to speak with the legal advocate. The legal advocate should be able to talk with you about your hearing and what to expect. Another option would be to look at the Unbundled List of attorneys (Unbundled-List-7-26-2###-2.pdf (###bar.org)) and consider possibly paying for a small quantity of an attorney's time to assist you in this matter. The list is here, and you can look through it to find an attorney to talk to. I would encourage you to reach out to attorney's in Anchorage or Juneau. It is possible for an attorney to appear by phone, so you are not limited to just Juneau area attorneys. Another option would be to call the ### Bar Association for a general referral to an attorney---###-800-###. I hope this helps and good luck at your hearing. \n",

Now that the children are absent and damage may be occurring along with potential criminal activity, I would like her to move out immediately. What are the next steps? It appears a Notice to Quit, but I don't see one that fits my circumstances perfectly. I want to follow the legal process. Please help.\n",
      "Hi -- is this ###?  ### ### here.  It was generous of you to help this family with a place to live.   I'm sorry that the family is having problems and that ### has removed the children.   I hope your property hasn't been damaged.You asked how to remove the mother now that her children aren't living there.    Here is some information:First, what is your long-range goal?  Do want this family out of your property even if ### might let the children come home?    Does it matter that removing the mother may affect her ability to get her children back if she has trouble finding another suitable place to live?   I'm asking because your next steps depend on whether you want this family gone, period, or you just want to be sure that they're not damaging your property.  Please let me know.Second, you asked how to remove this family from your property and what forms to use.   There aren't generic forms to fit this situation.  That's because the family probably are probably guests, not tenants.  There aren't clear rules or forms for removing guests who are no longer welcome.    I can send you more information about that if you'd like to proceed.### B.\n",
      "Hi, ### --I'm sorry for your loss and that you're having trouble getting information about your late uncle's estate and probate.  Here is some information that may help:You asked if you have to get an attorney to get an equal share of the estate.   Let me break that down into two questions:  (###) Do you need an attorney, and (###) will you get an equal share of the estate.You are not required to have an attorney.   In most probate cases, heirs don't get their own attorneys unless the estate is being mismanaged or there is a dispute about who the heirs are.   But, you are entitled to get advice from an attorney and even have the attorney formally represent you in the probate case.As to your share of the estate, I don't know whether you are entitled to an equal share.   That depends on who the other heirs are.   ### law determines who the heirs are (unless the estate involves Native/Indian restricted assets, in which case federal law governs those assets).   If all heirs are related to your uncle in the same way (like as nieces and nephews, as you indicated), then the estate will probably be divided equally among them.   But, if some are related differently (for example, as grand-nieces/nephews, or children, or siblings), some heirs may receive a different share than others.   You asked if you have to come to ### to receive your inheritance.   No, you don't.   The PR should send each heir his or her share of the estate.   If the estate includes stuff that can't be mailed to heirs who live out of state, like vehicles or real estate, the PR will probably sell those items so that heirs can receive their share in cash.   If there is any tangible object in the estate that you want as part of your inheritance -- like a family ### or a vehicle or a piece of artwork or whatever -- let the PR and his attorney know.   They're not absolutely required to honor your wishes, but if they know that an heir wants a specific item instead of its cash value, they ought to take that into account when dividing up the estate.You also don't need to come to ### to follow the court probate process.  As long as the Personal Representative and his attorney know your mailing address, they will send you a copy of any documents they are required to send to heirs.  If there is any court hearing that you want to attend, you will be able to attend by telephone.   If there is any information you want the judge to have, you may file paperwork with the court by mail (and, sometimes, email).Please note that the PR and his attorney are not required to send you a copy of everything that gets filed with the court and probably are not required to notify you of all court hearings.   If you want to get a copy of everything filed and get notice of all hearings, you should file a document called a Demand for Notice.   There is a generic version of that form available on the court's website at this link:https://public.courts.###.gov/web/forms/docs/p-305.pdf  When you file that form, you also have to mail a copy to the ### attorney, any other attorney who has filed an appearance (none at this time, per Courtview), and anyone else who has filed a demand for notice (none at this time, per Courtview).   If you have follow-up questions, please feel free to post another message on this website.Best wishes,### B.\n",

      "This is obviously a troubling situation. I have a few questions: why does your sister live with you and not her father? Has he kicked her out of his house or was this mutually agreeable?The law basically states that parents are responsible for their children until they are ###, unless the child is emancipated by the court earlier. Parents also have the right to made decisions for they children until they are ###. If her father has abdicated his responsibility for his daughter, you could contact the Office of Children's Services and file a neglect claim - or failure to support claim. Generally if the complaint has merit the state will place the child with a close relative if possible and will order the parent to pay child support. The problem for you is that you have no legal claim against him for child support unless you are awarded custody or care of your sister by the court. What you are doing now is consider just a favor. Child support is calculated according to this explanation http://child-support.com/wp-content/uploads/Alaska-Child-Support.pdfHave a look. Just because you need more does not necessarily mean that the parent actually has or would be required to pay more than you are getting. You would need to know his income and be able to calculate his payment.Hope that helps. Best. SR\n",

      "Dear Ms. ###:I can hear that you are fearful. However, unless you file for custody, you both have equal custody and either can take the child anytime to do anything. Your child appears to be at some risk when she is with her father because of his negligence in caring for her. You have little other choice but to file for custody and have a court decide whether he is a fit parent.You can file for custody and do that without an attorney. The ### Court System has a family law self help center that helps individuals who can't afford an attorney to prepare and file documents. In custody cases, unlike divorce cases, there is no provision for the other side to pay your attorneys fees. Here is the website:http://courts.###.gov/shc/family/selfhelp.htmYou should not concern yourself with the wealth of his parents. Custody is decided between the two parents and the grandparents are generally not involved unless neither parent is fit. You will need to document to the court that you deserve primary and full custody as a result of the father's poor parenting. If you achieve full physical and legal custody, then you would not pay child support. This will require a lot of evidence because courts generally start with the idea that kids need both their parents if they are fit, and that parenting should be shared. Here are the forms and information about child custody. This is a lot to take in, but worth your reading in full. http://courts.###.gov/shc/family/support.htmOnce a custody case is filed, there is also the option of getting a custody investigator's report of the father's parenting and/or mediation between you two over a custody plan. This can be helpful since either an investigator or mediator would ask the father some very solid and ### questions. I hope this helps with your deliberating what to do. Best. SR\n",
      "Yes. I think it might end up being an issue to get the court to agree to pay the lawyer out of the estate if that is contested, because a lawyer is not needed to be a personal representative.

      "Dear SirI am not sure how about your situation.  You say you are not divorced, are you paying child support voluntarily? The first step for you would be to file for divorce and custody. If you share custody then you pay less child support. If she has full custody then you would pay quite a bit more. There is a family law self help center at the ### Court System. The website is http://www.courts.###.gov/shc/family/selfhelp.htmThere is a lot of information there about filing for divorce, custody and child support and how it is calculated. ### disability income counts as income for calculating child support payments.

However, Iâ€™ve sent ### an adoption paper for him to sign and return for about a month now.

      "In that case, you and your fiancÃ© could file for him to adopt your daughter. Then your ex would have to respond to the court when you file the petition.  Another option is to contact child support enforcement division and ask them to start a case against him. That could motivate him to give up his rights to her because he does not want to pay child support and they would force him to do so if he refuses and he is her father.The ### Court System Family Law Self Help Center has some good reading and the petitions for adoption herehttp://www.courts.###.gov/shc/family/selfhelp.htmHere is the webpage for the ### Child Support Enforcement Divisionhttps://childsupport.###.govBest, SR\n",

So basically I will have two different cases open against him?I already contacted child support division and theyâ€™ve informed me they donâ€™t handle adoption. Also, I went on self help site, thatâ€™s where I found the adoption papers and sent to ###. \n",
      "Ah, you did not mention in your facts that he is not living in this state. That complicates things. The child support case is one in which there state of ### is working for you to enforce his obligation to pay child support for your mutual child. An adoption petition would be filed privately by your fiancÃ© to petition to adopt your child. Your ex would have to be served with that petition in ###ifornia, though. That may not be practi###. It is possible, however.I think at this time you should pressure him through the child support enforcement agency to pay child support and continue to let him know that if he relinquishes his parental rights he would be free of that obligation. It is easier for you to have the state CESD office do the work of running him down to pay support that he owes than to spend your time trying to personally serve him with a petition for adoption. If that strategy does not work, then you could contact the family law self help center and ask how to file a petition for adoption against your ex who is located in ###. There are ways that you can have him served with that petition. If he is served, he would be required to answer it. SR\n",
      "Finding an attorney is always a good idea. You can't represent your fiancÃ© in court. You want one who specializes in adoption. I am assuming that you and your ex are either divorced or have never been married. It may not be necessary to be married but it will likely not be convincing if you are not.  There is no limit on the duration of marriage, but your fiancÃ© will be taking on the responsibilities of the biological father, which means if you separate or divorce he will then be responsible for paying child support and child support enforcement can go after him for that. He should be advised of this and have his own attorney to move on this. SR\n",
      "It would not be a case against ###. It would be a petition to adopt your daughter. ### would then respond to that either giving up his parental rights or telling the court that he disagrees and does not want to give them up. The court would then have to decide. And it would be most appropriate if you were married when the petition is filed. You already have parental rights of your daughter. Your fiancÃ© would need to establish a good reason why he should be allowed to adopt her. Becoming your husband and agreeing to provide support to your daughter along with the fact that your ex is not supporting her sufficiently would be the best argument for a court to terminate your ex's parental rights and allow your fiancÃ© to adopt her. \n",
      "Okay. Is it a good idea for me to contact the biological father about the adoption paper I already have sent to him? Should my fiancÃ© and I ignore that paperwork and send petition? Or should we continue to wait for him send it back on his own time? Iâ€™m only eager to take action but I needed legal advise because I know what ### is capable of. I donâ€™t want to do anything Iâ€™m going to regret if I choose to interfere. Since he is holding the adoption paperwork and is not paying child support. My fiancÃ© and I only really care about my daughter being under our care. We rather have the adoption taken care instead of worrying about ### not paying child support. The thing is ### doesnâ€™t know I have his contact phone number. \n",
      "Two unmarrieds who have a child together each have equal custody rights to the child unless they get a court order spelling out who has primary custody with to without visitation, joint custody or some other type of shared custody. If you have no custody order then he has equal right to custody. If he relinquishes his parental rights he has no right to visitation or contact. He seems disinterested in having custody or visitation. He does not want to pay child support. I think that I would call him and ask if he got the paperwork and if he is willing to sign it. It seems like it is in his best interest to do that. Otherwise you just need to tell him that you have no choice but to try to get child support enforcement to have him pay child support. He apparently does not see a need to respond as quickly as you want to know his response. No reason not to call and ask. If he does relinquish his parental rights, he will no longer have child support payment responsiblity.SR\n",
      "Dear Sir:Unmarried parents of a child have equal rights to custody unless they have a custody/visitation order from the court. You may not need a lawyer to obtain one. The ### Court System has a Family Law Self Help Center that is designed for self represented litigants to file and obtain such an order. The website is here: http://www.courts.###.gov/shc/family/selfhelp.htmI would urge you to read the relevant items on this site and decide if that is what you want to do. One thing that you may want to be aware of is that if there has been any allegations of domestic violence against you by her (a petition for domestic violence restraining order, for example) that may trigger a presumption that she should have custody and you only visitation unless you can rebut that presumption or you are willing to complete an education course on domestic violence. If there are no such allegations, the general view is joint custody varying only based on the best interests of the child. You should also be aware that child support will be determined by the court also based on who has custody.  There is a very good section explaining child support also on the ### Court System website.

      "Dear Sir:I am sorry for your troubles with this as I have personally experienced public libel. It is extremely upsetting. Unfortunately, as I learned from doing some basic research, it is very unlikely to win any kind of legal remedy for the facts you have presented. I am sending below a nice summary of this area of law. https://thelawdictionary.org/article/how-do-you-prove-a-defamation-of-character-claim/In your case, there has been no public dissemination of hour partner's wife's libel except to your wife. Presumably your wife knows that this is untrue and it has not influenced her view of your reputation. In this case, she really has exercised her first amendment free speech right to make a statement to one person and she likely believes the statement to be true, based on unknown information. There is no likelihood that you could win any kind of legal libel suit based on these facts alone.If you find evidence that this person has sent a public statement of this nature, then you may have a better case. If you find that she has done this, you might want to consider sending a Cease and Desist Letter - even if you do not take legal action. It places her on notice that you would consider filing a libel action if she continues. Good luckSR\n",
      "Hi, I currently live in an apartment building in Anchorage with my husband and ### old. We moved in ### of ###. What we didnâ€™t realize was that property manager allowed smoking. Fine, we were ok because we could stay sealed in our apartment. But that was not the case. Our apartment get extremely hot during the summer because we couldnâ€™t open windows without getting fumigated with pot and/or cigarette smoke. We noticed some smoke smell in the our hallway where our heater and washer and dryer are are located but nothing too bad. But the weather has recently gotten chilly and the smoke in the hallway has gotten a lot worse with our neighbors doing all their smoking indoors. Iâ€™m very concerned about secondhand smoke, especially since we have a young baby and that kind of smoke is known to cause all kinds of health issues. We have air purifiers throughout the house but I know that can only do so much. My main question is this - do you think we can break our lease and not be penalized, citing unsafe living conditions? If not, what kinds of things can we request from our landlord to ease the amount of smoke in our unit? Iâ€™m going to bring it up with the property manager but wanted to see what my options are right now. Thank you.\n",

Smoking is one of those. If one does not think they can live with a smoking allowed rule, one should not rent. You may not be able to legally break the lease, but you could ask your landlord if s/he would consider a mutual termination with a month's notice.

Is anything mentioned about an inspection fee in your lease? As a practical matter, if you chose to sue your landlord for the reinspection fee, then you would have to show that it is unreasonable for it to be charged. I can't say there is any law on this. I think a judge could find it a reasonable expense since none was charged for the first inspection. It would also cost you a filing fee to file a small claims case against your landlord, and if s/he hired a lawyer to defend the case and you lost, you would owe him or her attorney fees.

If the order is not dismissed, the law requires that there is a rebuttable presumption that it is not in your children's best interests to be in your custody or for you to have visitation until you complete a domestic violence intervention course. You must be very certain to learn the status of any restraining order.  If one has issued, you could file a Motion to Dismiss it and ask for a hearing. http://www.courts.###.gov/shc/family/selfhelp.htmThis is the site for the Family Law Self Help Center for the ### Court System - hopefully this may provide further information for you about the ### support process.

      "Dear BrineyYou are in a precarious situation. I advise that you contact AWAIC (### Women's Aid in Crisis). I am concerned that you have been a previous victim of domestic violence and that your spouse's behavior will escalate as a result of his concern over your interest in divorce and child support.If you are fearful (and I think that you would be justified in that) you do have the opportunity to file for an ex party domestic violence restraining order based on any threats he has or is making to you. Check here for information about that process:https://courts.###.gov/shc/shcdv.htmMediation is not a process that is well suited to your situation because you are not in a position of equal bargaining power with a person who threatens to harm you if he does not get his way.  With respect to divorce and child custody and support, you want to look carefully yourself at the ### Court System Family Law Self Help Center information that will help you understand that process. You CANNOT waive child support payments under the law. Depending on the custody split, then the law sets a schedule of how much each parent pays based on their income. http://www.courts.###.gov/shc/family/selfhelp.htmThe above website discusses divorce, dissolution, and child custody and support - as well as domestic violence and how that impacts divorce and custody cases. I hope that this info is helpful to you as an overview. If you have further specific questions, feel free to ask - I will leave this question open for a few days.Best. SR\n",
      "Dear Ms. ReichertI have prepared a draft of a letter you could send to the tow company. You will need to fill it his and your address and the date of the oral agreement. If the facts are as you related, then you would owe for the tow and one way mileage to his yard. Not sure how far that was, but the $###. If you can get him to agree to that amount then perhaps Geico would pay it directly. The oral agreement you say you entered into is for the tow, so you would owe that amount.If he refuses your request to ### you for only the tow and continues to charge you for the entire amount, then you could sue him in Small Claims Court to get your car back. I am including the website for the ### Court System Small Claims Handbook, that describes the process for this. The fact that you can't pay for the tow is not a defense. He can sell your truck to satisfy the portion of the invoice that is what you agreed. If you do sue him in Small Claims court and you lose, you could get a judgment against you for whatever the court finds that you do owe plus whatever costs and fees he assumes by defending the case in court. One other option you may have is to offer to give the title to the truck to him to satisfy the debt. If you don't think you truck is worth more than the $###, then that is something that might work for both you and him. I will leave the question open for a few days in case you have questions.

      "Dear Ms. ###You are required to file an Answer to his Complaint or the court could find that since you did not, paternity is disestablished.If his name was on the birth certificate, it is absolute proof. If he signed a paternity affidavit then it is not absolute proof. A DNA test would be required if he is saying he lied under oath. He could be prosecuted for a crime of unsworn falsification for doing that, but that would not likely happen. I doubt that a court would find that he is responsible for support of a child that turns out not to be his with a DNA test.You should file the answer form you sent and contest his complaint to disestablish paternity stating that he signed an affidavit and provide the court with a copy of that affidavit. If he asks for a DNA test, then he could disestablish paternity but he would have to explain to the court why he signed an affidavit under oath. Since I don't know whether he is in fact the father, I don't know if you want to move for genetic testing. If you do, here are the formsget genetic (DNA) testing of the child, the mother and the man believed to be the father and the husband if the mother is married. The test results must be provided to the court. This can be done voluntarily if all of the people are cooperating or by court order.  To ask for a court order, you can file:Motion & Affidavit for Genetic (DNA) Testing, SHC-### | PDFOrder for Genetic (DNA) Testing, SHC-### | PDFBelow is the ### Court System website info on Paternity cases and how paternity is demonstrated, along with the court forms. There is also a family law self help center that may be able to advise you what forms to file and how to proceed. https://courts.###.gov/shc/family/shcpaternity.htmhttps://courts.###.gov/shc/family/selfhelp.htmI hope this helps.

      "I do not see any way around contesting this and getting a court order for two reasons. First, if the case is dismissed, then he can keep filing these and harassing you with them. Second, ### and Child Support Enforcement will require a finding. You should file an Answer and let the court decide the issue once and for all. This will also be in your child's best interest. If you want to send me s can of the Complaint that he filed I may be abler to give you more detailed help in specifically what to answer in response. Generally, you already know that you would want to deny his allegations and check the boxes that indicate that his name is on the birth certificate and any other information that you know about his paternity. You will have help if you notify ### that this is happening. When you are off ###, which you will be required to be some day, you will need to be able to enforce his child support payments (through the Child Support Enforcement Division).

      "### did not order anyone to pay child support. They are not in the process of setting up an order. I am receiving ### though. Okay thank you. Are you sending me the answer and counterclaim to file? If/ when DNA test is brought up, May I fight against that? What are my legal rights as well as my daughters?\n",
      "From what you have told me, I filled out the Answer and Counterclaims. The only reason you can ask to have the case dismissed is if the court has no jurisdiction over you. You both like in ### and so does the child, so there is no reason for dismissal. The court will decide the issue. It is for the father to prove by clear and convincing evidence that he is NOT the father, since he signed the affidavit and his name is on the birth certificate. The father does have the right to ask the court for the DNA test to obtain the evidence to show whether he is in fact the father. The court would require that you comply with that, so there is no point in objecting and it will appear that you do not want the truth found. If you do not go forward with this, ultimately ### will get the Child Support Enforcement Division involved and then they will do all of this anyhow, as a condition of your receiving ###.If the evidence shows that he is not the father, and the court finds that, then he can't be ordered to pay child support. He also has NO legal right to custody or visitation. If the court finds that he is the father, he will have an obligation to pay child support. He will pay it to Child Support to offset your ### while you are on ### and to you when you are off. He will also have the right to custody and visitation. You would want to think about getting a custody order from the court. Without that, you both have legal custody and rights to have the child and make legal decisions about her welfare. Fill out the parts of the Answer that I did not - your address, etc. You will need to mail to the court, to the father and to the Attorneys General's office listed and ### on the last page of the Answer. This is because the child is currently benefitting from ###. Fill out the Certificate of Service that says you sent copies to the Opposing Party (###) and the Attorney Gener's Office (check Other)You can send these by regular mail with a regular stamp. You do not need to use registered mail or return receipt.I hope this has helped you. Best, SR\n",

      "You can ask the court to order that he produce all records of income and expenses related to self employment, his last tax return and all documents he will provide for his upcoming tax return. You can at the same time argue to the court that the father has voluntarily underemployed himself and that is not a sufficient reason to reduce child support and that the court should impute his potential income to him that he would make if employed regularly. From the ### Court System Website:_______________________________________________________If I quit or take a lower paid job will I pay less child support?Probably ### court may order child support according to your potential income, based on your work and earnings history.This is called imputing.The court is likely to impute if you are voluntarily and unreasonably unemployed or underemployed.If you want the court to impute the other parent, you can file a Motion to Impute. See information on motion practice to learn how to file motions.Return to topWhat if I am self-employed?Income includes the gross receipts minus the ordinary and necessary expenses required to produce the income.However depreciation rules for child support are different than for taxes.See the Commentary to Civil Rule 90.###.Return to topHere is the whole website on child support and calculations - there is also a section on motions to modify. https://courts.###.gov/shc/family/supportfaq.htmThe court will have to find that there are sufficient 'changed circumstances' to warrant a reduction in support.

      "Dear Ms. AmioBefore I answer, I would like to understand more about why you want to move to limit his visitation. It appears he is not actually using it. Can you let me know what your goal is having the court order that he have less? Best, SR\n",
      "Dear Ms. AmioYou can bring a motion to modify your visitation order. What you attached here is not the Visitation Order - this is the Child Support Order. I don't see on here any reference to visitation. In any event, if you want to modify it, you will need to find the Order that says he has ###, etc. The ### Court System has a Family Law Self Help section on their website. https://courts.###.gov/shc/family/shccustody.htmHere is the section on filing a Motion to Modify -You can file a request to modify a custody (or visitation) order if there is a change in circumstances. A change in circumstances means something has happened so that the old parenting plan is no longer in the child(ren)'s best interests. Examples include:the original plan was for an infant and now the child is ### ###one parent is moving out of state so the existing schedule of week on / week off is impossiblethe parent whom the children were living with four days a week went to jail so the existing schedule is impossiblean act of domestic violence between the parents when returning the children.Your example would be that the father is not actually exercising the visitation and he is behaving in ways that are a negative influence for your children. The website will lead you to the forms that you would need to fill out and file with the court and serve on him. In the end, however, this will be a fair amount of work for you. It will open an adversarial process between you and him and could end up ### his negative behaviors toward you. And there is no guarantee that there court will change anything. In order to protect your children, regardless of whether they are travelling to see their father or travelling for any other reason, you should contact the Indian Health Service here that insures them and find out what coverage they have available to them in other states. This is not an area in which I have any special knowledge. I hope this helps. Best, SR\n",
      "Dear Ms. ###:It is always ### to have the other half say they want to make changes that are not specific and do not relate to the best interest of the child(ren). You do not have to agree to any changes but your could Beware that any changes that affect the 50-###, so you must factor that in as well. You do not have to agree to changes and you can wait until the court gets involved. You should be aware, however, that any time the court becomes involved, you lose control of the outcome. Your ex has the opportunity to file a Motion to Modify Custody. In that motion he will have to show there is a change in circumstances. A change in circumstances means something has happened so that the old parenting plan is no longer in the child(ren)'s best interests. Examples include:the original plan was for an infant and now the child is ### ### / week off is impossiblethe parent whom the children were living with four days a week went to jail so the existing schedule is impossiblean act of domestic violence between the parents when returning the children.To modify child support, there needs to be:a ###5% change in the amount of child support ordered (this means that when you calculate support based on the parentsâ€™ current income now, it is ###5% more or less than the current support order), ### change in the parenting plan from primary custody to shared custody or vice versa that affects the child support formula. You may find the FAQs on Child Support helpful to decide whether to file a motion to modify child ### ### Supreme Court has issued many decisions about what types of circumstances amount to a change of circumstances allowing a modification.Here is the statute that sets out there 'best interests' of the child the court has to consider:Sec. ###5.######.###50. Judgments for custody; supervised visitation.  (a) In an action for divorce or for legal separation, for placement of a child when one or both parents have died, or as part of a child-in-need-of-aid proceeding for a child in state custody under AS ###7.###0, the court may, if it has jurisdiction under AS ###5.###0.###00 â€” ###5.###0.######0, and is an appropriate forum under AS ###5.###0.### ###5.###0.###60, during the pendency of the action, or at the final hearing or at any time thereafter during the minority of a child of the marriage, make, modify, or vacate an order for the custody of or visitation with the minor child that may seem necessary or proper, including an order that provides for visitation by a grandparent or other person if that is in the best interests of the child. The court shall hear custody proceedings related to a child in state custody under AS ###7.###-in-need-of-aid proceedings, as provided under AS ###7.###0.#########, unless notice is provided to all parties to the child-in-need-of-aid proceedings and no party objects to hearing the custody proceedings in another appropriate forum.(c) The court shall determine custody in accordance with the best interests of the child under AS ###5.###0.060 â€” ###5.###0.######0. In determining the best interests of the child the court shall consider (###) the physical, emotional, mental, religious, and social needs of the child;(###) the capability and desire of each parent to meet these needs;(###) the child's preference if the child is of sufficient age and capacity to form a preference;(###) the love and affection existing between the child and each parent;(5) the length of time the child has lived in a stable, satisfactory environment and the ### of maintaining continuity;(6) the willingness and ability of each parent to facilitate and encourage a close and continuing relationship between the other parent and the child, except that the court may not consider this willingness and ability if one parent shows that the other parent has sexually assaulted or engaged in domestic violence against the parent or a child, and that a continuing relationship with the other parent will endanger the health or safety of either the parent or the child;(7) any evidence of domestic violence, child abuse, or child neglect in the proposed custodial household or a history of violence between the parents;(8) evidence that substance abuse by either parent or other members of the household directly affects the emotional or physical well-being of the child;(9) other factors that the court considers pertinent.(d) In awarding custody the court may consider only those facts that directly affect the well-being of the child.So, you will want to be prepared to explain all the reasons why it is not in the best interest of your child(ren) for your ex to have a change in the custody schedule. If he can show that he can't get another job and these are the only hours, then that would be in the children's best interest largely because he supports them ###. If he is just looking for a change to suit himself, then the question would be how often is he going to be doing that? The court will not want to hear motions over and over. He must be prepared to commit to a schedule that becomes their routine. At the same time, the court will have likely give him a one time schedule change for a job if he can't work out one that keeps to the original schedule. Here is the ### Court System website that explains more about modifications of custodyhttps://courts.###.gov/shc/family/shcmodify.htmI hope this helps give you the legal considerations. I will leave this question open for a few days in case you have any follow up concerns. Best, SR\n",
      "Have you thought about requesting mediation? What is going on between you is really not about modifying the custody schedule. It is, as you note, more about communication and establishing a real co-parenting plan where you each do what is in the best interests to the child, so that each of you know who has them and when and what should happen if there is an emergency. If he is not communicating you can also resort to the court to ask for an order that he disclose. But as you can see, resorting to the court is a long process and does not always lead to a better place.If he files a Motion to Modify, perhaps request a mediation. That would involve a facilitated discussion and may work better for you in hammering out an agreement that you can both follow and feel that you both contributed to making. Best, SR\n",

      "I got my apartment around the beginning of February of ###â€™s infestation of cockroaches and I was okay with that. During my time of moving in I noticed that it was also infested with shrews as well. The landlord did pest control treatments for my apartment for the roaches but nothing was done about the shrews for about six months in.

      "Dear Mr/Ms. AmioRegardless of the roach/shrew situation, if you give notice that you intend to move at the end of your lease and you clean the place and return it in the same condition in which you rented it, you are entitled to your deposit back. You should notify him before the end of January that you intend to leave by the end February. You should ask your landlord to do a walk-through of the place with you a few days before you move out so that he can let you know if there is anything he believes you need to do to clean it to his satisfaction to get your deposit back. Look at your lease and see whether it requires that you shampoo carpets or do anything special before you move out. Take photos of the place on your departure so that if you ever have to sue him for your deposit back, you can show that you left the place in the good condition. I am attaching the Landlord/Tenant Handbook that has a lot of good information about security deposits and cleaning requirements. I hope that helps. \n",
      "Dear Ms. ###:Once I file the answers/responses to disestablish paternity and motion to DNA testing that the previous attorney filled out.

However, you will be placing yourself in a bad position with the ### and Child Support Enforcement - and they may file anyway to assure that he really is not the father. They are entitled to get child support from him if you are on benefits, and you are entitled you are not.If we are ordered to do the DNA testing may I object?###) you can always object to testing. The court is most likely to require it. It is the only way to determine the truth of the matter.Also if the results come back that he is or is not the father may I request that he be disestablished?5) if the results are that he is not the father, he has asked for disestablishment so it would likely be granted. All you have to do it agree. You do not need to make the request.Is there any chance that he will still have parental rights if he is not the father? May I do a motion to disestablish him in my response even if we do not do the DNA testing? (answered above - you do not need to do a motion, you would file your answer agreeing with them that he is not the father and not file the one that I helped you to prepare.)6) he will have no parental rights if the court determines he is not the father. I hope this answers your questions. I will leave the question open for a few days. SR\n",
      "I filed the one you helped me prepare. So after we do the DNA test and it shows that he is or is not the father. What happens next? Since he's on the birth certificate it won't change if he is the father. If he's not the father being on the birth certificate means nothing? You said I can object testing what repricussions does that have on me? ### told me while I was pregnant and after I gave birth that he would do DNA testing yet he didn't and signed the acknowledgement of paternity anyways is that negligence on his part? Or any other ground? He is still involved in his daughter's life as well. Under what grounds am I able to bring that up? We've been together almost three years. There was a brief time we weren't together. I was drinking heavily and had a one night stand. He knows about that. As I know about who he was with. Other then when we were apart I've been loyal to him. He is the only father my daughter knows. What can I do to ensure our family stays together?\n",
      "You ex has the right to establish that he is not the father because that has far reaching consequences for him in terms of his legal requirement to pay child support. As a practical matter the court will not hold him responsible for that if he is not the biological father, which is why the court would rule against you if you contest DNA testing. The court seeks to find the truth. Signing a birth certificate is only some evidence that he is the father. It does not create a presumption, as it does legally when two people are married and the wife has a child during the marriage. I am not certain what would happen with the birth certificate. There may be a way that he can amend it if he is found not to be the father, or he may just end up with a court order that says he is not so that he does not have to pay child support. As far as your 'family' is concerned. There is nothing about a court order that says you can't be a family. If he is interested in the child and he is not the bio dad, then you have full custody and you can decide whether he should have visitation and what kind and under what circumstances. It would be up to him if he would like to continue the relationship. Your child is ### and she will understand that if he is not her bio dad, but he shows her love and the gift of time, that he is a 'heart' dad. Far more important that an bio dad that never shows up to contribute.I hope that helps. SR\n",

I think that he is within the time limits for contesting the acknowledgment because no one has sought to establish child support or health care payments.  He filed to disestablish paternity and he will argue that there was fraud or material mistake - (that he is not the actual father.)

      "Dear Ms. MiersYou must file for divorce and custody in order to preserve any marital assets from his interference. There is a family law self help center that provides assistance so that you can do this yourself without counsel. The court will then have a list - provided by you- of marital assets and can issue an interim order that prevents him from spending joint assets or changing any deeds to property until the divorce is done and any marital property is distributed. The court can also order him to leave the home and allow you to stay there in the interim until divorce (if it is safe) or award the house to you or require it be sold and the proceeds distributed between you. Child custody should also be determined, as you do not want him to be able to claim full custody of your child I assume. Here is the website. http://www.courts.alaska.gov/shc/family/selfhelp.htmThe self help center used to do classes in how to fill out and file the forms for divorce and custody.

He must call the witnesses who actually heard the noise. If he does, he can seek an eviction order regardless of whether you have paid rent. You can ask for a period to time to remove your belongings. The court generally gives two days for non-payment of rent, but you could ask for end of month with the agreement that you will not make any noise for the remainder of the month. Most judges don't like to evict at Christmas. That would be up to the judge, though. Good luck\n"

      "Dear Ms. ###The ### Court System has a robust family law self help center. Many people file for divorce and custody without an attorney. The website is here: http://www.courts.###.gov/shc/family/selfhelp.htmThis self help center was established because it is so difficult to find a lawyer to do a simple divorce. Have a look at the information and the forms that you would need to file. If you give the self help center a call you can find out if they are still holding classes to fill out these forms and answer questions about the procedures involved. I hope this helps you to feel confident enough to proceed if you wish to do so. Best. SR\n",
      "Hi ###,I am sorry to hear that your new car broke down almost immediately. And that you are having trouble getting reimbursed for a rental car from ###. My understanding from your posted question is that you have a contract with ### that provides the cost of a rental if your new car breaks down within a certain time period. Your car did break down within a week of when you bought it, and your rental cost was $###.80. ### has agreed to pay you only part of that amount, $###. In your explanation, you say you have tried to get help on the phone multiple times and have gotten conflicting answers. It doesnâ€™t sound like you have received any response from them in writing. Iâ€™m recommending that you send a written request. More details on that below.The first thing you should do is check your contract language again carefully â€“ make sure it says that you are entitled to a full refund for the cost of rental while your car was being repaired. Look for any language that tells you where or how to make a claim. You said that the dealer told you ### is responsible, and that ### offered you partial reimbursement, so it probably is ###, but do check the language carefully. I did find some limited information about the Optional Vehicle Protection Plan for ### online, and that website states that coverage is only up to $###. But if you have a contract that states it covers the full cost of a rental, then that language should control.You will want to enclose with your letter to ### a copy of the contract that covers rental reimbursement, a copy of the receipt for the rental amount, and make sure and keep a copy of everything, including the letter, for yourself. Send this letter â€œcertified mail, return receipt requested.â€ What is in quotes there is what you want to request at the post office. It will cost about $5.### .###. You can ask for and fill out the forms at any United States Post Office counter. You will then receive proof that ### received your letter if you have to make a second demand for payment.Here is some sample language that can help you write a letter to ###. I put in some information in brackets where you will need to fill in the information.Dear ### Customer Service Center (or other department if your contract gives you a claims department),              I have a contract that covers rental of a vehicle while my car was broken down. Please see attached contract, signed on [INCLUDE THE DATE YOU SIGNED IT]. I purchased the car on [INCLUDE DATE].  It broke down on [INCLUDE DATE]. This contract covered a rental vehicle while my car was repaired [INCLUDE THE DATES YOU HAD The RENTAL]. I paid $###.###. Please see attached receipt.              I request full reimbursement. [IF THEY PAID YOU $###, YOU WILL NEED TO SUBTRACT THAT AMOUNT FROM YOUR DEMAND.  IF YOU RECEIVED $###, THEN YOU WOULD REQUEST $249.80. OTHERWISE, ASK FOR ###.80]. Please send a check to this address: [INCLUDE YOUR MAILING ADDRESS].Sincerely,### ### [Include your full mailing address]I hope this answer helps you resolved your claim with ###. If you have more questions about the reimbursement contract, it would be helpful if you upload the contract.Thank you for using the Free Legal Answers platform for your question.\n",
      "Dear Mr. ###:This case allows a sex offender subject to the ASORA to file a civil case with the superior court to have the court determine that the offender is so low risk that s/he should not be required to re-register. The burden is on the person filing the case to show that they have rehabilitated so fully that they pose no further public safety risk. If you had a public defender in your original case, I believe you should be able to call and ask for information on how to do this, since it arose from the terms of your original sentence. You could certainly try that now. I have not dealt with a case like this. I will do further research next week and ask some colleagues if they have done cases like these and give you a written update then.  Best. SR\n",

      "A post conviction relief application is the type of civil case that you would have to file. You can't get your conviction set aside for the reasons that you are trying to have the court find that you do not have to ### for the ASORA. You can ask the court to modify the sentencing condition that orders you to register by showing that you are rehabilitated and that you now pose no harm to the public. Criminal defense attorneys specialize in this sort of petition. It is a civil matter but it is filed with the sentencing court and it relates to the criminal judgment. Here are the forms on the ### Court System website to file your own application. If you do so, and you ask for a lawyer, and you fill out the financial paperwork and are eligible for a public defender, the court should appoint one to represent you. If you did not qualify for a public defender because you make too much money or have too many assets you would have to hire your own attorney. If you are going to do that, you might contact ### ### as he is the lawyer who won the Doe case in the Supreme Court. I am sure he has done a number of these post conviction relief type cases. Post Conviction ReliefCIV-###CIV-###CIV-###Ultimately you will have to show that you have done all programming that you were ordered by the court to do and that you have had no violations of probation of any kind.

When you mention a modification of sentencing and I only done a year and they donâ€™t do a set-aside. Can the court least bring down the class C felony into a class A  misdemeanor.Iâ€™ve done most of the research and it seems like every state has some type of a set-aside or expungement for first time offenders depending on the case so they can get a job it seems like ### does not have these type of laws.Besides getting off the registry what other post conviction Relief I can try to do.

      "My ex-wife and I divorced back in August of this year. As part of the dissolution, I agreed to cede full custody of our four children to her because I did not have a good job or apartment in Anchorage yet. After I managed to obtain those things, I began taking my children overnight multiple days a week. Over the last three months, the percentage of days I have had the children is approximately 45%.I approached my kids' mom with a proposal to complete an uncontested shared custody agreement. She refused and told me that she wanted to retain full custody. I filed the DR-###, and an Interim Motion for the same. When I told her that I was serving her papers for the motion, she immediately reduced the amount of time I was seeing the children. I am representing myself in court Pro Se because I do not have the money for an attorney and the legal aid office is booked. I've drafted up an outline, but I'm concerned that I won't cover the points I need to cover, and I'm having difficulty anticipating any rebuttals her attorney might have.I'm going to begin with a Significant Change in Circumstances which seemed to be underscored very strongly as the minimum threshold for the case to be heard. Under this reason, I would talk about the new job, and my apartment, along with the schedule we've kept over the last ###.Reason ###, nurturing environment for my children. For this point, I would describe their living conditions while in my home, my involvement in bringing them to school every day, and taking turns with their mom staying home on sick days.Reason ###, and that her actions are causing them anxiety and instability. Examples of this are her reaction to being served as well as her desire to take them all back to the lower ###, ###, which would severely affect my ability to maintain a relationship with them.What I'd like to know is:Do I have a winnable case?Am I making the right arguments?Is there anything I should NOT mention?What rebuttals should I expect and how can I combat them?Attached is the outline in detail, as well as a copy of the original custody order.\n",
      "Dear Mr. ###:You definitely have experienced a changed circumstance. The reason your ex does not want you to spend more time with the kids is because she wants to keep he child support order the way it is. The court will look again to the 'best interests of the child' standards in the law tot decide who they should be with and for how long per week. Those are (c) The court shall determine custody in accordance with the best interests of the child under AS ###5.###0.060 â€” ###5.###0.######0. In determining the best interests of the child the court shall consider (###) the physical, emotional, mental, religious, and social needs of the child;(###) the capability and desire of each parent to meet these needs;(###) the child's preference if the child is of sufficient age and capacity to form a preference;(###) the love and affection existing between the child and each parent;(5) the length of time the child has lived in a stable, satisfactory environment and the ### of maintaining continuity;(6) the willingness and ability of each parent to facilitate and encourage a close and continuing relationship between the other parent and the child, except that the court may not consider this willingness and ability if one parent shows that the other parent has sexually assaulted or engaged in domestic violence against the parent or a child, and that a continuing relationship with the other parent will endanger the health or safety of either the parent or the child;(7) any evidence of domestic violence, child abuse, or child neglect in the proposed custodial household or a history of violence between the parents;(8) evidence that substance abuse by either parent or other members of the household directly affects the emotional or physical well-being of the child;(9) other factors that the court considers pertinent.(d) In awarding custody the court may consider only those facts that directly affect the well-being of the child.(e) Notwithstanding the provisions of (d) of this section, in awarding custody the court shall comply with the provisions of ###.S.C. ###90### â€” ###96### (P.L. 95-608, the Indian Child Welfare Act of ###978).(f) If the issue of child custody is before the court at the time it issues a judgment under AS ###5.######.###60, the court shall concurrently issue a judgment for custody under this section unless, subject to AS ###5.######.###55, the court delays the custody decision for a later time.One thing you should know is that a history of domestic violence between you and the other parent can affect the custody or visitation arrangement for your children. The law presumes that the parent who committed the domestic violence might not get custody and visitation unless he or she meets certain requirements. These may include completing a battererâ€™s intervention or substance abuse treatment program. To find domestic violence, the law does not require the existence of a protective order or criminal charges. The divorce or custody judge may ask about domestic violence. Hopefully this does not apply to your situation.Your arguments in your case outline are good - I would relook at the best interest of the child factors above and see if you can add anything to your outline the addressed these specifically, if you did not address them already. Otherwise, I think you are good to go. The court does not like having to recalculate child support but it also starts generally from the premise that both parents are entitled to equal time so I think you will find some relief through the court. Best, SR\n",
      "Dear Ms. McHoneIt appears you have a court order that gives 100% legal custody to each of you and 50/###. Legal custody is the piece that governs consent to medical care. It would appear that you each have the legal authority to consent. Without seeing the actual court order, I can't tell whether there is any obligation to confer with each other before consenting to a medical intervention.Best, SR\n",
      "Dear Ms. PokornyYou have not given many facts here. I can only really tell you what my impression is of ###. They pretty much hold all the power in our situation. Your best bet is to work with them and not adversarially to them. They do have an obligation to your child - and whatever plan they have suggested to you is one that you should try to follow as best as you are able. Following the plan is what will lead to reconciliation with your child. I expect that ### has required that your husband have no contact with the child. If so, they are looking for you to be protective toward your child and assure that is the case. I can't imagine that in this defunded environment that you will find anyone to help you sue ###. If they do move to terminate your parental rights then you will have the right to counsel and counsel will be appointed to you. In that case you will have an advocate. Best. SR\n",
      "Thank you for the response. There is police video/audio as well as the police officers testimony who reported us to ###. His statements do not match what the ### worker put on his petition. The Petition says there were drugs in the room where my son was at and it also states that my husband was using drugs. When the police officers testified they both said there were no drugs anywhere and my husband appeared to be sober. I understand the best and easiest thing to do is do what ### says but its not in the best interest of our child and how many other children are going through this because ### says so? They actually came to my home tonight and took my son away from me. And believe me, I'm not the typical kind of parent that ### is usually dealing with... I have literally never broke the law and would never hurt a fly (I don't even ### or have never even smoked a cigarette)I'll leave it at this... They are getting away with treating families unfairly but no one is listening to me. Everyone tells me the same exact thing, if ### says jump, you jump. This might sound unprofessional and childish but I honestly feel bullied by them. Anyways I appreciate your response and your opinion.Thank you and I hope you are having a better night than I am.Hidy Pokorny\n",
      "Dear Mr. SaccoMarried parents have equal rights to custody of their children. If you leave state to work that does not constitute a 'legal separation.' You should consider creating a document that states that you are leaving state to find new work to support your family, that this does not constitute a marital separation but only a relocation and spell out the visitation arrangement that you would like to have with your child - where, when, who pays for the child's travel if that is the case, and then you can both sign it and have it notarized. It would be an agreement between you and it would be evidence later if she decides to file a divorce and custody case. Best, SR\n",

The court will then inquire why he signed it and will consider the DNA evidence.The DNA evidence will be the most important. If the test comes back that he is not the father, I believe the court will order that his signed acknowledgement should be withdrawn. If that is the case, he will have disestablished paternity. If the test shows he is the father, the court will make that finding regardless of whether he signed an acknowledgment. You will certainly be allowed to cross examine the plaintiff, but he is the one with the burden of proving that he is not the father. I think you should prepare for whatever the results of the DNA test show. Hope that answers your questions. SR_____________________________________________________________________________________________________AS ###5.###0.###.The court is going to have a hearing where he will get to show that he is seeking to withdraw the acknowledgment within those time frames. If he can't show that more likely than not he is within the time frame, then if he denies he had sexual contact with you that could have resulted in ###, the court will order DNA testing.I think that he is within the time limits for contesting the acknowledgment because no one has sought to establish child support or health care payments. He filed to disestablish paternity and he will argue that there was fraud or material mistake - (that he is not the actual father.) I think the court will order testing and I think you will be ordered to comply. You will like be placed under oath and should tell the truth about what you know about his paternity of your child.The laws are below.AS ###5.###0.050. Legitimation By Subsequent Marriage, Acknowledgment in Writing or Adjudication.(l) The tribunal shall consider a completed and signed form for acknowledging paternity that meets the requirements of AS ###8.50.###65(a) as a legal finding of paternity for a child born out of wedlock. For an acknowledgment signed on or after ###, the acknowledgment may only be withdrawn by the earlier of the following dates: (###) ###, or (###) the date on which judicial or administrative procedures are initiated to establish child support in the form of periodic payments or health care coverage for, or to determine paternity of, the child who is the subject of the acknowledgement. After this time period has passed, the acknowledgment may only be contested in superior court on the basis of fraud, duress, or material mistake. The parent wishing to contest the acknowledgment carries the burden of proof by a preponderance of the evidence. Unless good cause is shown, the court may not stay child support or other legal responsibilities while the action to contest the acknowledgment is pending.e) Except as provided in (i) of this section, in proceedings in which paternity is contested, the tribunal shall order the parties, including the child, to submit to testing as described in (d) of this section upon request of(###) the child support services agency created in AS ###5.###7.###; or(###) a party, including a sworn statement(A) alleging the paternity of an individual and setting out facts that show a reasonable possibility that the mother and that individual had sexual contact that could have resulted in the ### of the child; or(B) denying the paternity of an individual and setting out facts that show a reasonable possibility that the mother and that individual did not have sexual contact that could have resulted in the ### of the child.\n",
      "Good morning,So if ### does not have any evidence showing that it is within the time limits of AS 25.20.050, what do I say in the court proceeding? Or how do I proceed with my cross examination? Along with him stating we did have sexual relations during that time, what would I say to him as well as the judge for my examination? If ### has no evidence or little evidence am I able to request that the judge close the case at that moment? When I signed up for ### it stated it was automatically going to open a child support case against him. ### asked for his name, date of birth, social security number, mailing and physical address, as well as employment information when I applied, will the court go by that date? I also applied for SNAP benefits and Medicaid that same day until I could find employment and a babysitter for our daughter. Will the judge go by that date? Also when ### is providing evidence as well as witnesses am I able to object? He has stated things that are not true that he wants to bring up in court. I do not want the judge to take account of false information, so if I'm able to object when will I be able to do so? The DNA test that he submitted with his motion was a do it yourself at home DNA test. I was not there when he did it as well as my daughter had mouth ###, how can I cross examine that evidence? What would fraud or material mistake involve? If and when a DNA test is ordered and the results come back, what are the outcomes if he is the biological father and if he is not the biological father? What are the legal options in both outcomes? I will tell the truth about the paternity of my child. I am ###% sure he is her father. ### was not in her life for ###. Does that have any relevance in the case? Is it relevant to bring up similar cases? I apologize for so many questions, I just want to make sure I do everything accurately, so please bear with me and help me understand what I do not understand. Thank you so much and Happy New Year.\n",
      "###,I am so sorry to hear of your situation. There may be some options for recourse, but they are likely limited and will depend largely on the ###s of the offer you received (and accepted).  It sounds like you reached an agreement about the job, and so you may have a contractual or promissory estoppel claim.  The challenge is that ### allows employers to hire people at-will, meaning they can be fired without a specific reason, and most job offers are clear that they are for at-will positions.  If your offer was different and, for example, gave you a guaranteed minimum ###, you could more easily claim damages from the employer.  This case from the ### Supreme Court, involving someone who was offered a two-year position that was rescinded, is a good example of what that looks like.  But if your offer was at-will it's a lot harder to hold the company to it.  Even if they did let you start, they could have fired you on the first day. There are a few limitations to at-will employment, however.  For example, they could not fire you or rescind the offer because of your race, religion, etc. (see the full list of protected categories here). They also have to comply with what is known as the duty of good faith and fair dealing.  This has two requirements.  First, they can't intentionally act in bad faith.  In your circumstance, that might mean something like knowing they did not intend to hire you when they gave you the offer.  Second, they can't act in a way that is objectively unfair.  This typically shows up where an employee is treated differently than other employees in the same situation; in your circumstance, this might mean something like rescinding your offer for reasons that they ignored for other employees. I would suggest the following.  First, do what you can to find another position.  Even if you do have a claim against this company, you would have an obligation to try to mitigate your damages by finding a job elsewhere.  Second, I would carefully review the offer and other materials they provided to understand what you (and they) agreed to.  They likely said the offer was for an at-will position, and they also likely said that the offer was contingent on meeting certain prerequisites (e.g., passing a reference check). Third, if you clearly satisfied all the prerequisites, I would consider reaching out to them again to ask for an explanation.  They aren't obligated to provide one, but the mere fact of your following up suggests that you are taking the issue seriously may prompt them to try to give some sort of explanation.  It's unlikely to lead to them reoffering you the job, but it might provide information helpful to you for future applications.  And it's also possible you learn something that suggests you might have a claim.Best of luck to you.\n",
      "My ### (her ###) for a little over a year now. Both of her parents left the state (Ketchikan, ###) with no intentions of returning or any sort of financial support.

      "Dear Ms. ###The easiest way is to have your parents repeat the power of attorney delegating authority to you. But there is also the option of applying for a guardianship. I have copied the ### Court System information and links to forms here. Applying for guardianship is more complicated for sure. You could do it and if your parents agree it should not be a problem, so long as you have the ability to do the work. You have to watch a course on guardianship, create a plan for your younger sister and file an annual report of what you Powers of Attorney & GuardianshipPower of Attorney for care of a childA parent may choose to delegate his or her parental rights to another person for up to one year. This is often called a Delegation of Powers by Parent or Guardian. It can be revoked by the parents or guardians at any time for any reason, AS 13.26.066. You can fill out Power of Attorney Over a Minor By Parent or Guardian, PG-701 . You will need to check a box stating whether you are delegating all or specific limited powers and responsibilities to another person and also fill in the amount of time it will be valid. You do not file this form in court, but instead provide it to the person to whom you are delegating powers and keep a copy for yourself.To understand how a power of attorney is different from a guardianship, please see Office of Public Advocacy's Public Guardian information page.I will leave this question open for you to ask any other questions that may arise from this information for you. Best. SR\n",
      "Dear Ms. ###If that is your only question it is easy. Try to obtain an attorney first. Then your attorney can have her attorney (or her) serve your attorney with them instead of you.

      "I am confused at to which son now. Did you list your first child as a beneficiary by name? Did you list your second child by name? If the children were listed by name, then all you should need is a birth certificate and evidence that you are the child's mother and entitled to manage his money. I think I would make a written request to the state and ask then to give you a letter stating what is necessary for each of your children to claim benefits. Then you will have something in writing that you can pursue. It is difficult to try to respond to the state without knowing exactly what the situation is.With respect to other benefits, like social security and veterans, I think you will need a court order and as I stated, that is complex and you probably need a lawyer.

      "Dear SirUnder common law judges are immune from civil liability for errors made so long as they are made in the course of their duties as a judge and the judge has jurisdiction to do enter the order that s/he entered. In your case, if I understand the facts, the judge was acting within his jurisdiction to issue a court order in your case but he erred by filling out the paperwork that placed you on formal probation supervision instead of informal court supervision. It sounds as though it is true that you should not have been arrested. On these facts, the judge has immunity from civil suit and the department of corrections was not negligent in doing what it did, because they apparently acted appropriately on the paperwork that was actually, though erroneously, filed.  I am sorry for your distress. I can imagine how difficult it is to have been so successful as to graduate wellness court, which I am VERY familiar with, and to then be arrested for an error. Try not to hold that against the judge or the state. In truth, judges process thousands of documents a week. It feels very personal to you, but it was not. I am certain that during your participation in wellness court that you felt that the team was supporting you and wanted you to be successful. And you apparently are! Don't let this get you down. Move past and just keep making that next right choice for yourself!Happy New Year. SR \n",

      "This may seem like too simple of an answer, but I think your best option is to sue him in small claims court. You could sue him for the amount in storage fees that you incurred. If you wanted to get a court order for him to remove it, you would have to file the lawsuit in circuit court. This is probably not a financially viable thing to do.You could also send a letter to him stating that he has until a certain date to get it, or you will dispose of it. If he doesn't get it, get rid of it. Be sure to keep all the evidence of all of this.It sounds like he may not even be in the country any more. If that is the case, you probably cannot bring a lawsuit against him. You can, however, send the letter and get rid of the item.\n",
      "If I understand correctly, your landlord has moved you from your uninhabitable property into a new property, and he wants to charge you a deposit to do so. The question here is how the new property compares to the previous property. If the rent is greater, you can be charged a deposit for the increase. If the rent is the same, you cannot. Put simply, you cannot be charged more for a security deposit than one months' rent. This remains true when you are moved to the new property. If the damages to the old property were not your fault, your landlord cannot use the security deposit to help pay for those damages.\n",

I don't believe that you could be required to physically\" force your children to see their father.  This assumes that you have not continued to say negative things about their father to encourage them to not see him.  Another question was the father ordered to pay child support and did he in fact make those payments.  I would suggest that you sit down with your children and discuss this issue to see if a compromise can be reached.  I don't believe a court is going to agree to a situation where the children never see their father.  This is just a general recommendation for you to start with.  This way you can avoid further legal expenses. \"\n",
      "I understand your frustration and I admit that I agree with your feelings.  It is highly unlikely that he will hire an attorney.  But if he does, he has to answered where the money came from to pay his attorney and yet not pay for his children support.  You can go to DHR and request that they garnish his wages if and when he returns to work.  For a father to quit his job in order to get out of child support is used frequently but it will eventually upset  the courts.  I don't know what else to say to you.  I wish you good luck in your future.\n"

      "Hello ###,     Thank you for your response.  Iâ€™m sorry I could not be more prompt â€“ I had computer problems pertaining to document retrieval and attachment.  If you have trouble in receipt of them or opening them, please be in touch.  I will send them again or even mail them.     Yes, I do have copies of both my legal separation and final divorce.  â€œAll assets, debts and all other property was addressed completely in the binding Settlement Agreement executed by the parties on ###â€, and â€œAll of the provisions of the Settlement Agreement remain unchanged and in full force in effect.â€  The above language is taken directly from the Uncontested Divorce paperwork attached (see Settlement Agreement, no. ###, nos. ###).  This is an unsigned electronic draft of the divorce papers â€“ an exact copy of this was signed by us, but it was not sent to me electronically.  However, the Final Decree of Divorce does refer to the settlement agreement which â€œis incorporated into and made a part hereof as though fully set out herein.â€  I have attached electronic copies of the Motion for Final Order (Settlement Agreement for Legal Separation), Decree of Legal Separation, Uncontested Divorce paperwork and Final Decree of Divorce.     I understand your explanation of a Motion for Enforcement or Motion for Contempt, and that both the alimony and life insurance matters can be included in a single motion once he fails to adhere to both terms of our agreement.  It will certainly be obvious if he fails to make the alimony payment(s).  What is a problem is that I would not know if he fails to renew the life insurance policy in question. At the time our legal separation was completed, the life insurance policy owned by my ex-husband with myself as beneficiary was with First Colony Life Insurance Company.  [First Colony Life was acquired by GE Financial Assurance and later became ### Life and Annuity Insurance Company, a ### Financial company in 2007]  Although it was mandated that he maintain a policy worth $85,###, I was given no means by which I could check on its status or inquire whether he had made a beneficiary change. In other words, my lawyer who should have known the drawbacks, did not stipulate that my ex-husband provide a way for me to periodically look into that.  After our papers were filed, I realized there was no oversight on this issue and I contacted the company.  I could find no one who would talk to me because I was not the ###.  After a few attempts, I did finally get someone who told me I could mail them a copy of the agreement to put on  file.  He said that legally they would have to abide by what was mandated, and that if my ex tried to change the beneficiary, they would not allow him to do it.  Of course, that does not solve the possible problem that he might have allowed it to lapse.  So I did send them a copy of the agreement to the address given me and by means that would indicate it was received at their facility.  But when I called to learn if it had gone to the right department, I was told again that they could not speak with me.  I think you can understand how great a problem this has been, and there was no one to help me with it these last ###.  I feel that this will be a problem again (if I am able to get the court to enforce this requirement), unless some directive is added whereby the company is made to be ### to myself as the beneficiary through regular channels of communica-tion.  There has to be a system of oversight in place.        Regarding your question about my ex-husbandâ€™s financial status, he is retired from the ### (###) and his working career (2015).  We married in ###/privileges until our divorce.  He receives a full military pension, is covered by Medicare and Tricare for Life, also receives full Social Security benefits, and had a substantial ### until he cashed it in to purchase a home in ### for himself and his first ex-wife (he reconnected with her during 2013, began an affair in ###, and then moved in together).  To my knowledge, he has not experienced any reduction in income because of illness or injury.  But he does spend money impulsively and recklessly, often making bad decisions.  During our marriage I discovered I was the only one interested in saving.  He refused to budget or to even be accountable for his expenditures.  It is this innate tendency to spend uncontrollably that would result in the need for him to claim it is financially impossible for him to honor the agreement in our divorce decree.  [His first ex-wife also receives Social Security, commissions from all of the insurance policies she sold when she worked with her ex-husband in his insurance business, and alimony from that ex-husband (who knew nothing of her affair with my ex when they divorced in the fall of 2014)].  She also markets handmade ### through her online business and at craft shows.  Together, they have adequate resources.     I feel that as I have honored the terms of our divorce, then he should be required to as well.  I was awarded a $### alimony, but I was required to allow him to reduce  that amount dollar for dollar by the benefit amount of Social Security that I began taking in 2017.  I was not even allowed to reduce it after subtracting the premiums I pay for Medicare B and D, as well as the supplemental policy I had to take.  It is also my feeling that my medical troubles ought to figure into this.  I have had a bad back since ###, and I had ### invasive surgery in 2005.  During the separation and divorce, I was told that I could try to qualify for disability.  It wasnâ€™t something I thought I should do, since I was capable of working a job and being productive.  Besides that, my exâ€™s departure has made it pretty certain that I will have to continue to work.  I do not have a ###, just an ###.  But last year my back deteriorated so badly that it was necessary for me to have complex back surgery â€“ a multilevel (8) ###.  I traveled to Chicago for this, spent two weeks in the hospital (ICU and Rehab), and was out of work on medical leave for ###.  (This was one of three surgeries I had in the space of ###.)  I had just started back to work when the coronavirus pandemic arrived and put me out of work again.  I am being paid a minimal wage just to keep me on the payroll, so I am not eligible for unemployment compensation.  Without the now small amount of alimony, my situation will be precarious.  If it becomes necessary for me to file a motion to enforce terms, I hope the judge looks at the entire picture.  I am sorry this is so long, but I thought some detail could further enlighten you as to my predicament.Regards,### Reagon   P.S. - I was unable to attach the unsigned Uncontested Divorce paperwork because it is a document and not one of the file types allowed by this website.  The other files should have come through okay though, and they should allow you to make the connection between the original separation agreement and the final divorce.  If you need to review it after all, I could still mail it to you\n",
      "Hi ###,Thank you for attaching the documents--this helps tremendously. I understand the difficulty that arises regarding the life insurance policy, and it is undoubtedly more difficult given the hurdles with the insurance company and sending the appropriate documentation. Here is my suggestion: ###) I would recommend reaching out to your ex-spouse (in writing) and ask him to provide documentation regarding his active life insurance policy in the amount of $85,000. If he does not provide you with the information, or refuses to send it to you, then ###) file a motion with the Court, either a Motion for Enforcement or Motion for Contempt, requesting that the judge enforce the terms of the agreement. In this motion, you can ask for the judge to A) enforce the life insurance policy requirement, making your ex-spouse provide documentation to the court as to the ### current status and B) amend the settlement so that the agreement includes the appropriate checks/balances so you will remain aware as to the status of the life insurance policy. An appropriate check/balance would be requiring your ex-spouse to update you every year (or every ###) as to the status of the life insurance policy--this can be in the form of an email or forwarding you a statement from the insurance company. Another option is for your ex-husband to submit the divorce agreement directly to his representative at the life insurance company. This would then allow you to call the company and check on the status of his life insurance policy (without him having to send you yearly, or periodic documentation). I hope this helps. Please let me know if you have any further questions. - ###\n",
      "###,     Thank you for looking over the documents and providing a course of action.  I do have a few questions.  First, what type of documentation would be adequate - a duplicate copy of the policy in question, an annual statement from the insurance company, or their letter indicating the upcoming expiration of the policy?  Should I be specific about a document in particular or give him a choice to choose from?  Truthfully, I donâ€™t expect him to send anything and if I get any response at all, it would most likely be a vicious text.  (One year I sent a certified letter, letting him know the reduced alimony amount, and he did not sign for it, so the P.O. returned it to me.)  I was thinking of setting a deadline, maybe returning to me within ###.  Would this be appropriate and do you suggest registered mail?  Second, are you saying that if he does not reply (or does w/o sending me anything) that I may go ahead and file the motion even this same month, and not wait until after the ###ination date of the policy (###).  You were specific in your earlier response that â€œnothing can be done until he fails to adhere to the ###s of the agreementâ€.  You may be suggesting this as a possible way to get around that, since we do not actually know if he has kept the policy in force as mandated.  Third, if a Motion for Enforcement or a Motion for Contempt is filed with the court, does it serve as a request for the judge to enforce the agreement as a whole or is it necessary to specify the different components of the agreement that need to be enforced (alimony, life insurance or both)?  Earlier it seems you were saying that each part needs to be addressed in the same motion.  The problem is that if I were to file a motion before the 22nd, I would not have his alimony payment or know if he will follow through and pay it (the 22nd is the due date).  [I believe his threat to end his alimony payments is due to his belief that this will allow him to then refuse to replace the expiring insurance policy.  As you have read in our settlement agreement, the life insurance policy ($85,000) with me as beneficiary must remain in full force and effect â€œso long as alimony is due to her or until the end of the present ### of the policy, whichever event is the latterâ€.  In order to know for sure whether he intends to continue making alimony payments, I should probably wait until after ###nd  (any response or lack thereof will  likely take that long), so that if need be I could address both of his failures to adhere to the ###s of our agreement.  Does this seem like a reasonable plan to you?  If not, what would be better?     I am posing these questions to make sure that I fully understand what you proposed as a course of action and that I am on board completely with what you have suggested.  Also, I want to know if I may leave this conversation open as this process unfolds, so that I may report on my progress and check back with you if there are unexpected develop-ments.  In other words, is it permissible according to the rules of your website to leave this dialogue open as I have suggested in order to be in touch over the course of the next few weeks, while I am attempting to resolve these issues?  It would certainly be simpler to have communication with you, as you are already familiar with my issues.  Any additional problems/questions would also be directly related to the original question I submitted into the website. ###P.S. â€“ Also, thanks for the earlier attachment about Alimony and Support.  By the way, I have not remarried, and I have not been in any relationships nor do I plan to ever be.\n",
      "Hi ###,In response to your first question, I would suggest either an annual statement from the insurance copy or a copy of the policy that shows the expiration date. As you suggested, I think including a date (i.e. please provide the requested documentation on, or prior to, ###th). I chose ###th because that is the date of the ### expiration, correct? If the ###th date is incorrect, then I would suggest including a time frame that closely resembles when you suspect the policy is set to terminate. Further, I would send the request via registered mail and keep the tracking number that USPS gives you for added proof that your request was in fact sent/delivered. In response to your second question, I would suggest waiting until the end of the month to file something with the court. As I briefly mentioned in my original response, courts are oftentimes reluctant to do anything until the terms of an agreement are actually violated. Thus, if you send your ex-husband the letter requesting documentation, and he fails to provide it to you by ###th (or the date you select), then I would go ahead and file a Motion with the court. I am glad to hear that your ex-husband provided you with the alimony payment! Please feel free to leave this conversation/message chain open\" so we can continue to correspond. Please do not hesitate to reach out should you have any further questions.\"\n",
      "###,     Truthfully, I do not know the actual expiration date of the policy.  I just remember that it said ### of ###, and so that seems to indicate the policy is active through the end of ###.  As I do not know for certain and to give him adequate time to respond, I believe I will tell him I need to have the documentation by the end of the fourth week in ### (Sat., the 27th).  By sending my letter out later today, he should have nearly ###.  I donâ€™t expect a response, or at least a civil one.  So if I donâ€™t have something by the date specified, I will go ahead and file a motion on Monday, ###.  I assume that date is close enough to the end of the month.  (I havenâ€™t asked you what my course of action should be if he does send me documentation on the old policy.  I am, as I have told you, very certain that he will not willingly follow through and replace the old policy with a new one as he has been mandated to do.  Documentation on the old policy will probably not help to reveal what he has or hasnâ€™t done in light of its imminent expiration.  But I will wait and see what he does, and I will let you know of my progress.)     Thank you for providing direction in detail and also for allowing me to keep the dialogue open.  I believe it might actually close automatically, if there is no correspondence within ###.  So that doesnâ€™t happen, I will just provide the occasional update to make certain it remains open.  I hope you have a nice weekend.Regards,### \n",
      "###,      On Friday afternoon I mailed the letter to my ex.  After speaking with the postal clerk, I decided to send it priority mail and he will receive it today.  I chose this method because it provided a tracking number and the letter does not have to be signed for (either of them could have signed for it).  It will simply be delivered to his address and ### time overall, since he cannot refuse to accept it.  If there is any question as to his receipt of it, GPS will confirm that it arrived at his address.     However, I am writing you today to tell you that I found the letter I had earlier written to the insurance company.  I came across it quite by accident, because at about the time I began communicating with you I had torn up my home searching for what I believe was a copy of my exâ€™s insurance policy.  To this date, I have not located it.  This letter, though, includes the policy number (5618107) as well as the date of issue (###).  I don't know if policies expire by the anniversary date of issuance after the designated ### of the policy.  But if that is usually the case in the insurance industry, then this policy has probably already expired.  I tried to attach the letter to this email, but since it is a .doc file the website will not allow it.  Therefore, I have copied and pasted the letter into the body of this email following my comments.     After you have looked this over, please advise whether I should still follow the present course of action and file a motion (irregardless of his response or lack thereof) by the end of this month, or if a more immediate action on my part is now necessary.Thank you,###### Life and Annuity Co.P.O. Box 10720###, VA  24506Attn.:  Legal Dept.                                                                                                                                                                                                     ### Dear ###:      I spoke to a representative of your company last Monday (Nov. 23, 2015), who spoke with you, the legal dept., on my behalf while I waited on the line.  This concerns the ### life insurance policy (policy number - 5618107) belonging to my husband and on which I have been the beneficiary since the date of issue (###).  This past July we agreed on a legal separation which states that this $85,###.  I copied the portion of the document pertaining to life insurance below:                                                                                                                   Life Insurance            8.  The husband shall maintain in full force and effect the currently existing life policy with First Colony Life Insurance Company in the face amount of Eighty-five                        Thousand and No/100 ($85,000) Dollars with the Wife designated as beneficiary of the same so long as alimony is due to her or until the end of the present ### of                  the policy, whichever event is the latter.     Some amount of alimony will continue to be paid by my husband for several years.  I believe when this was formalized there was about a five year ### left on the policy.  The representative gave to me the information she received from you, which is that ### must abide by the ###s of our legal separation.  (Attached to this letter please find a copy of our legal separation agreement.)  She stated she was informed by your office that when you have completed your review of this separation agreement, a notation will be added to the policy that will prevent any change of beneficiary for the duration of the policy.      I thank you in advance for your cooperation with this legal matter and the ### of which I am told you will handle its documentation.  Sincerely, ### L. Reagon \n",
      "###,      I received a certified letter from my ex today.  In it was a short note along with copies of the first ### (there were apparently ###).  I donâ€™t know why he did not forward the policy in its entirety as asked (â€œYou may send either a copy of the latest annual statement from the insurance company or a copy of the policy itself which shows the expiration date.â€), except that he may not want me to see the Schedule which is referred to on page ###.  I am attaching the file entitled Response from Ex = insurance documentation for your perusal.        The two most obvious questions I have is:  (###000487) why the value of the policy is nowhere shown on this part of the document, and (###000652) what does the Expiry Date of ### on page ###?  (I am not knowledgeable regarding insurance, so I plan to call a friend of mine later today who has sold insurance in the past and who may be able to enlighten me as to the ###s of this policy.)  Please let me know if his omission of the full policy and his obvious denial of the full ###s of our agreement (as per his statement) is enough for me to move to file a Motion for Enforcement or Motion for Contempt at this point.  I am not familiar with this type of document [you have said that I may ask the judge to both (a) enforce the insurance policy requirement and (b) amend the settlement to include proper checks/balances so that I remain aware of the status of the life insurance policy as it goes forward], but I hope there is room to detail those requests on it.      Please let me know if either the assumptions that the policy is already expired or that he has stopped making the required payments changes anything as to the course of action I need to take in response.  If I learn anything about this type of policy, I will forward the information to you.  My initial research seems to indicate that even though this was a ###00065### ### life insurance policy, many companies are allowing clients to keep policies by renewing them for additional ### periods, and evidence of the ### ### need not be furnished.  But renewal will occur only if premiums have been paid to the renewal date, and the renewal ### life insurance premium might have to be paid within ###. This process may extend outward past any renewal date for this policy, but of course if he had intended to be bound by the ###s of our agreement he could have easily learned this information for himself.  And what if he has, but instead renewed naming someone else beneficiary of the renewed policy.  My ### is that there were choices for him to keep the policy if he was of a mind to continue it.  Thanks for looking this over.  Regards, ### \n",
      "Hi ###,I apologize for the delayed response, but I appreciate your patience!I am glad that your ex-spouse sent you the documentation; unfortunately, I am unfamiliar with insurance policies and will need to do some digging to familiarize myself with the Expiration Date (###) and the Expiry Date ###. If you end up speaking with your insurance friend, please let me know if he/she has any insight. In the meantime, I will do some reading online and see if I can gain a better understanding of the difference among these terms. As for next steps, my suggestion is to wait until we are able to figure out the difference in the terminology. If the insurance agreement is active through ###, then your filing with the court will need to discuss that and simply ask the court to amend the settlement to include proper checks/balances so that you remain aware of the status of the life insurance policy going forward. If for some reason, the insurance agreement did in fact expire on ### (and your ex-spouse has not maintained the life insurance), the filing with the court will need to include both (a) enforcement language, and (b) checks/balances language (as we had previously discussed). Once we get a more definitive answer on the expiration date, we can discuss options for filings with the court, and including language requesting the court require your ex-spouse to provide you with a full copy of the insurance policy, as opposed to three pages. In summary, I will conduct some research over the next few days, and will plan to check back in towards the end of the week. At that point, we should have a better idea of what we need to do. Thanks again for your patience! \n",
      "Hi ###,      I spoke to my friend who sells insurance on Tues. night.  What he told me goes along with what I learned in my research.  This was a ### life policy which for the last ###. had an initial annual premium of $###57.70 (or $###000###878###000652.### ### - ### and Dec.).  At the end of this initial ###, there is an option to renew the policy by continuing to pay premiums which on the anniversary date would become a higher amount - he thinks a significant amount.  The exchange date of ### then is the date that the client may elect to renew the policy and pay the new premium.  This period of time goes until the Expiry Date listed as ### - this is a ### of ###. after which â€œno insurance will be provided under this policyâ€.   (I think their calculation is incorrect as none of these ### life policies are valid after the insured reaches the age of 95 - for him that would be just short of ###000###8700 â€“ so this would ###inate ###. earlier than that if he were to live to 95.)  So, the insurance policy will not be active until that date unless he has elected to renew and paid the new premium, which would have been due on ###.  There is a grace period of only ### (that date would be ###).      Yesterday, in preparation for having to file a motion, I called the courthouse in order to learn something of the process (required items to bring with me, what paperwork is to be done, the associated cost, etc.).  Youâ€™ll be surprised to know that the first person who helped me told me that since my divorce case is closed, I would have to file a petition to open a new case to the tune of $######7.  (She said the judge might throw out my petition as my divorce was now a closed case.)  I related to her that my instructions had come from the lawyer who is helping me with this, and I told her the ###s of my divorce and what I hoped to accomplish by doing this.  She passed me along to a supervisor who initially seemed to agree with her, but who finally said if I wanted to do a Motion for Contempt based on my divorce case they would file it for me.  She also said that it would not cost me anything to do, which surprised me.  I am not counting on that â€“ there is bound to be something that will have a fee attached.  I was also told that I couldnâ€™t get the paperwork to fill out from that office, but I could visit the law library inside the Huntsville-Madison County Library to get the proper forms.  I spoke to a lady in that office, and she sent me ### â€“ (###000###87) Domestic Relations/Child Support Information sheet, (###000652) Contempt Petition, (###) Summons â€“Civil-, and (###) Affidavit of Substantial Hardship and Order â€“ Civil (she said this was in case I needed it).      Let me know whether all or part of these forms will be needed, as well as any she may not have included.  You may have intended to forward the appropriate forms to me after your research, and I would be happy to have you do that as I have not printed these out.  I have looked them over, and I have some questions about a couple of them.  In particular, the Contempt Petition has a middle section for requesting a hearing as well as other relief.  Is a hearing a necessary part of this action, or do these things get settled in different ways?  (That may be the ### reason for the Hardship form.)  Also, the form asks the name, address, and phone number of my attorney â€“ I donâ€™t know if this is necessary since I sign the form as the Petitioner.  Anyway, I know we will get to these things in time.  I thought I should let you know what research I had done and about the discrepancies I am hearing.Thanks,###\n",
      "Good morning ###!     Thank you for your reply.  I do agree with â€œit is unlikely that he will extend given the premiums associatedâ€ as regards a renewal of the insurance policy in question.  I also like to approach decision-making logically and anticipate all possible ### and the outcomes.  However, I am confused about your statement in paragraph ###000652, â€œThus, as the Agreement is written, when the present ### of the life insurance policy comes to a close, that would be the latter event there may not be a legal requirement to extendâ€.  My understanding of that section is whichever of those two things (alimony payments or the end of the present ### of the policy) outlasts the other would be the latter.  Here it is the alimony payments which will and do continue beyond the expiration of the present ### of the policy, as we understand is ###.  This agrees with the argument you make in your third paragraph.  But I donâ€™t see how the above stipulation of â€œthe latterâ€ can be interpreted in any other way.  It seems incorrect to me that the end of the policy earlier this month could be thought of as the latter event.  Could you help me to see this from your perspective?  It is important to me - I really want to see and understand this particular item.  I believe I can see how a second interpretation can be pulled out of that statement, but it rather seems to be secondary to which part is the latter.  One part of the statement refers to â€œthe currently existing life insurance policy, and the other part refers to â€œthe end of the present ### of the policyâ€.  If one agrees that the latter is the alimony payments that have no designated end, then the statement does not seem ambiguous to me and then a second interpretation would not seem to be viable.  The only question would be whether a judge would feel it â€œfairâ€ to enforce him to renew the policy when higher premiums are associated with it â€“ the point you make in your fourth paragraph.        I am concerned about the time and expense aspect you mention later.  The problem is that I am not acquainted with what will occur if I were to submit a motion.  That is what I was ### to when I asked about whether a hearing was a necessary part of this process.  Like you, I would want a reasonable expectation of the outcome if I was to move forward with an action.  The courthouse said they would not charge me to file a motion, and even if the summons were to be sent by certified mail, there is some kind of charge.  I suppose that if my ex decided that he would renew (if he was even able to do so within the period allowed by the insurance company), this could be handled solely by paperwork.  But if he objected, then I imagine that a hearing is a foregone conclusion and the motion states that the plaintiff is responsible for the costs.  Could you give me a better idea of how this course would go, if my assumptions above are not accurate?  Do you have any estimate of costs related to a hearing?  Quite obviously, I am a person of little means.  I took this course of action because of that.  If court costs for filing a motion myself are high, then consulting with a family law attorney would certainly be even higher, especially if I chose to move forward with a lawyer to handle this for me.  If their advice was that a positive outcome is doubtful, then maybe a fee for a consultation would not be extreme in comparison.      I would very much like to hear anything you can tell me about your interpretation of the word â€œlatterâ€ in my first paragraph and why it does not make the ambiguity you are seeing less of an issue.  After that, I would be interested in your gut feeling (you do not have to ### it for me) of my chances going forward with this.  Your last note was written highlighting the problems you saw with the ###s of my agreement, and it gives an impression that my position is less than desirable.  But I would not mind hearing what your gut feeling might be if this was a case you were representing â€“ my feelings will not be hurt.  I am appreciative of both your help and honest feedback on this situation.Thanks,###P.S. - I do wonder if he is not challenged on this item, whether he will indeed follow through with his threats and stop his alimony payments next.\n",
      "Hello ###,     Thank you so very much for your in-depth response and good information.  It is good to be aware that there is some ambiguity in the wording of my agreement.  Your explanation did allow me to visualize the other interpretation of which you were speaking.  In the end, it is quite ### that it does take a lawyer to make a full interpretation of most legal documents.  I do appreciate your insight and helping me to understand it.  Thank you also for your ### opinion that the first interpretation â€œis the most straight-forwardâ€.  Finally, I do understand that the judge may not see it that way, and he could rule in favor of my ex-husband instead.  If that was to be the case, I will not have lost anything by trying.  There is rarely any regret for following through, only for not doing so.  I have no expectations.     At this point I am working on the forms.  With municipal buildings closing tomorrow for the ###th holiday, I wonâ€™t be able to file until Monday.  I am more concerned that it may go against me, when I consider your statement that the judge may â€œfind that it is not financially feasible for your ex-husband to renew the policy, especially if it has already expired and is outside the ###0-day renewal periodâ€.  Monday will be ###th and the grace period for renewing the policy only goes through Wed., ###.  I might have been able to get it filed earlier, if I had already been in possession of the insurance contract as well as aware of the real expiration date on the policy.  Iâ€™m afraid that the cost to obtain a policy will likely exceed the cost to renew an already existing one.  (But I received the insurance pages from him with little more than a week left in the month of ### and would not have received them at all if I had not requested them.)     Thank you for letting me know that a motion will most likely result in a hearing, and that there is no cost for a hearing.  With this eventuality, I have three concerns.  ###000487.) He might hire an attorney to represent himself at the hearing.  If that happens, it is probable I would feel fairly inadequate to appear and represent myself.  I guess it wouldnâ€™t hurt to have a backup plan here.  ###000652.)  I am not aware of what the time might be between filing a motion and the date for a hearing.  Because of COVID-###0004879, my ###. with my surgeons in Chicago was cancelled.  I will have to head there at the end of next week in order to keep my ###. on ###.  I hardly expect a hearing to take place that fast, since it appears that he would be served sometime next week.  But it would cut down on my time to prepare.  (It also seems that even were I to have filed earlier, waiting on a hearing would more than likely push past the insurance grace period for renewal anyway.)  ###.)  You stated that â€œIf the judge does NOT issue an Order to Show Cause, you will bear the burden to show that your ex-husband violated the Agreement.â€  It was indicated to me that when I file the motion, I should include all paperwork that the judge should see as to why I am filing (ie, the agreement outlining the requirements for alimony and the ###s for retention of the insurance policy).  Also, as you wrote to me earlier, my request for additional oversight in keeping up with the status of the policy, since that was not allowed me during the initial policy ###.  (This will require the attachment of a statement to the motion, since it will be difficult to fit my statement regarding these on the motion itself.)  With this kind of documentation provided to the judge, what would my â€œburdenâ€ to show that my ex-husband violated the agreement look like?  Does one need to make an argument in front of judge as well?  And would it be supported by my lack of means (largely because of the divorce itself and my loss of Tricare For Life as well as military pharmacy benefits - all things I had for ###.), and the ongoing health issues I have been plagued with in the last few yrs.?  In other words, if he can defend his position by citing any health problems, is that argument allowed to me as well?            Thank you for explaining what a Motion for Contempt is based on and that it does not require a â€œnew-caseâ€ fee.  With your permission, I will use that language if I encounter a problem when I appear to file the motion.  I also appreciate your inclusion of the website which summarizes what will happen when filing a Motion for Contempt with the court.     And finally, it was interesting to find that my ex deposited the alimony for July first thing yesterday morning.  Since he was required to pay alimony, he has never sent it on the first of any month.  It seems he may be attempting to be too agreeable.Thanks and have a great ###th holiday!###\n",
      "Hi ###,Thank you for the update. I am glad you were still able to travel to Chicago for your appointment. I hope you are able to settle in and get some much needed rest once you return to Huntsville.I was not expecting the judge to dismiss on its face, given you are enforcing a ### of the divorce agreement, and therefore should not qualify as a new-filing, but rather falling under the ### of your ###. And as you noted, one way around this would be to file an entirely new action, which (unfortunately) is an expensive endeavor, sometimes costing some $500. Yes, your ex-husband will likely receive notification from the court, based on the address you provided in your documents. However, if he fails to sign for the paperwork (like he may have done for your service of process) it is likely that he will never know and the papers will simply be returned to the courthouse. Regardless, I would not worry either way. If he receives notice that the case has been dismissed for lack of jurisdiction, that should not pose any problems for you. If he chooses to withhold alimony because of this, then you may proceed as we previously discussed. I do apologize that this was not the outcome either of us was expecting, but I do appreciate the opportunity to help you and answer your questions. If you do not have any further questions, I will close this question que. Thank you, and have a wonderful weekend. Stay safe. \n",
      "Hello ###,     Thank you for your response.  My trip went well â€“ so glad I did not have to drive after all - and I received a favorable report from my surgeons in regard to the progress of my spinal ###.  It was, however, good to return home and to a normal schedule.     I was also hopeful that my motion would receive the proper attention of the judge who received it, and that he or she might at least schedule a hearing to investigate its merit.  At this point it may not be worth pursuing, but I would like to know how long you think that I can wait before filing a new motion.  Since my ex-husband has not accepted the papers I sent as yet and the P.O. will not begin the process of returning them to me until ###, I have a certain amount of time to wait before doing anything else.  I believe that if nothing has happened thus far, he will be more likely to think that he can stop making his alimony payments.  If that happened within the next few months, I would file a new motion citing his failure to continue with his regular alimony payments as well as to maintain an active life insurance policy.  In other words, how long do you think a judge would think that it is appropriate for me to ask that the life insurance mandate be enforced (either by itself or in combination with the mandate to pay alimony)?  I think that if my ex decided in another year or two to discontinue alimony payments and I did file a new motion, his failure to maintain an active life insurance policy would at least support my request for enforcement of the alimony mandate.  It would show his intention to disregard the terms of our divorce agreement in whole.  But while a judge may enforce the alimony mandate, he or she may not enforce the life insurance mandate after enough time has passed.     I am curious about what thoughts you may have on this.  I guess you could refer to it as a â€œstatute of limitationsâ€ for filing a motion for enforcement/contempt before a judge for my ex-husbandâ€™s failure to follow a mandate either by itself or in combination with a second mandate. Thanks,### \n",
      "Hi ###,Very well said. I think you are in a good position to proceed with the discussed course of action in a few months, should your ex-husband fail to make his alimony payments.

Should you have any questions in the future, please do not hesitate to use this website as a free resource. I will do my best to monitor the question queue for any future questions you may have.

      "Hello,The Child Support Order will be applied under the laws of the state of ###, and not Texas. To answer your question, because the Child Support Order was issued in ###, applying ### law, the child support order will remain active until the child reaches the age of 19. A Texas family court would be required to apply the ### Order (and the age of 19) because of a uniform act called UIFSA (Uniform Interstate Family Support Act), which requires states to uphold the child support orders issued by another state. I have attached a document with information on UIFSA and highlighted some of the important topics, for reference. Absent a court ordered modification, the child support agreement will remain in effect until the child reaches the age of majority, which is ###. Assuming you are still an ### resident, if you wanted to modify the child support order to reflect ### (as opposed to 19), you would have to file a petition with the ### court that issued the original child support order.

      "Kinship guardianship has been increasingly being used. It creates a legal relationship between a child and caregiver that is intended to provide care for the child.

It would be best to do some research into the type of business you want to have and then write up a business plan.

For example, you may need a permit to conduct your business and there may be zoning laws that you need to follow.Decide what type of legal entity you want your business to be. For example, you may want to consider creating an LLC, a corporation, or other business type rather than sole ownership. There are documents that you need to have to create a LLC or a corporation. Check with the ### Secretary of State's office and do a business name search. see https://www.sos.###.gov/business-entities. Chose a business name that is not in use, reserve it and register it.Register your business name with the county clerk where your business is located.

In other words, under the UCCJEA, ance a state exercises jurisdiction and decides the issues of child custody by entering custody order, that order is given full faith and credit by every other state. Full faith and credit means that the Courts in every state will recognize that child custody order, including any subsequent order issued by the original court.

To provide you with a more comprehensive answer, do you mind attaching the child custody agreement so I can review?To the extent the child's father and yourself cannot agree to what the best educational choice for your children may be, you may need to reach out to the family law court which would determine the issue based on the best interest of the child.\" Your local school system may also provide guidance on at-home education due to the Covid-###.

      "It is important to identify whether these are federal loans or private loans. Since you said they were deposited into a bank account, I think they are private loans.

That will probably not work. Another option is to go after your in-laws for these loan amounts. Basically what you would have to do is prove that these were student loans, that the money went into the joint account, that they took or used the money for non school purposes. Whether this is a good case depends on your evidence, so the question is whether yo can prove this.Unfortunately, there is a good chance that you will not be successful in these options, and you will have to deal with these loans. You may want to consider refinancing the loans, if your credit is any good. As far as what they can do to you if you don't pay, the question there has to do with what you income and assets are, so I cannot answer that.It is also important to realize that you will not be able to bankruptcy these loans, if they were distributed as student loans.

      "Employee rights and privacy during COVID are challenging issues.You can argue that your testing would be enough for your employer to comply with then Department of ### requirements. For your conversation with your employer, I am referring you to the ### U.S. Department of ### Revised Enforcement Guidance for Recording Cases of Coronavirus Disease ###0###9 (COVID-###9) that provides updated interim guidance to Compliance Safety and Health Officers (CSHOs) for enforcing the requirements of ### ###, specifically cases of COVID-###9.See, https://www.osha.gov/memos/###0###0-05-###9/revised-enforcement-guidance-recording-cases-coronavirus-disease-###0###9-covid-###9. One consideration is the reasonableness of the employer's investigation into work-relatedness. Employers, especially small employers, should not be expected to undertake extensive medical inquiries, given employee privacy concerns and most employers' lack of expertise in this area. It is sufficient in most circumstances for the employer, when it learns of an employee's COVID-###, (###) to ask the employee how he believes he contracted the COVID-###; (###) while respecting employee privacy, discuss with the employee his work and out-of-work activities that may have led to the COVID-###; and (###) review the employee's work environment for potential SARS-CoV-###. If, after the reasonable and good faith inquiry described above, the employer cannot determine whether it is more likely than not that exposure in the workplace played a causal role with respect to a particular case of COVID-###9, the employer does not need to record that COVID-###.Meanwhile, please consider ### guidelines that advises a person to elect to self-quarantine if her or she has been in contact with someone who has COVID to help prevent tits spread. See https://www.###.gov/coronavirus/###0###9-ncov/if-you-are-sick/quarantine.html.If you have to self-quarantine, you may be eligible for unemployment depending on the facts of the situation.

There are some by laws with in the custody agreement, the one in question stating I cannot, or any other person of the opposite sex, sleep over until we are married. The same applies for him. As it were, I own a couple of properties one of which I moved out of and let her rent from me. Legally binding contracts and lease agreements were signed. I own a camper which is parked near her residence and this is now used as my primary residence. As it stands can her ex husband use the fact that I am sleeping in a camper within the same area as her as grounds to hold her in contempt of custody agreement?\n",
      "Thank you so much for your reply. It is as I assumed it would be. I used the example of her renting a property in a neighborhood and myself renting the property next door.

Any documents you attach to this channel are treated with the same level of attorney-client confidentiality as it would be, should you meet an attorney in his/her office. I am happy to review the screen shot of the agreement if you feel comfortable doing so. If not, that is ok, too; however, please just be advised that as a general response to your question, so long as neither you nor your fiance are spending the night with one another, i.e. after the children go to bed, then there will be no contempt of the agreement. \n",
      "Thank you for attaching a screen shot. The language contained in the Custody Agreement is fairly standard. So long as you are not residing in the same house overnight as your fiance when the minor children are present, there would be no contempt of court. If the children's father were to have issue with you residing in a camping on the same property as your fiance (but not under the same roof), it would be very unlikely for a court to find that this amounts to overnight company with the minor children present.\" I hope this helps. Please let me know if you have any other questions or would like me to clarify/expand on any matters discussed herein. \"\n",

This was not in our lease nor did we know. The neighbor also tells me that we are not allowed to have our black friends over or any cops..... umm my brother is a cop and my boss and friend are black. This was a threat to me. She tells me her kids will play in our yard as they please and the dogs will do as they please. I leave and my fiancÃ© goes back down to the rental home to try and discuss some type of compromise but he was met with pur ignorance. The landlord told us that night to get our ### and get out that night. Well a couple days go by and we wait for the landlord to get back from his vacation so we could give him keys and get refund but he refused a refund and threw rocks at our car due to him being mad that we did not give him keys or lease because he did not give us a refund.

Iâ€™m his only child. By his first wife. He was married to second wife at time of death and had no will. His wife hasnâ€™t opened his estate. Can I do it without her? She wants everything. My grandmotherâ€™s estate and everything of my dads. I know Iâ€™m legally entitled to half. But because I donâ€™t trust sheâ€™d give me my half if she is executor, I have concerns. I know she wonâ€™t agree to me being executor. Also, my dad ran up a bunch of credit card bills before he died. I want my half of my Grammys estate ($30,###â€™s 3rd would be). I also want some of my fathers tools, guns and items but she wonâ€™t let me take anything out of the house. She wants it all to remain at their home. He had ###.  One was from my Grammys estate. He has a utility trailer that I want, titled in his name alone, and they jointly own their home which is about to be paid off. Worth $###00,000. Iâ€™d be happy with ###/###, the utility trailer and half his guns and a few personal items he made himself including a lighthouse that he said would be mine. I am up in the air about my grandfathers truck. I wonâ€™t fight for it. Iâ€™d like to have it because my stepmom is keeping the car in his name thatâ€™s worth more but Iâ€™d rather have utility trailer. My dad has a 20x###â€™t talking a small amount of tools. My Grammy has an estate attorney and a fair executor. How do I proceed? How do I ensure my interest is protected. I only want my 25% of my dads house if my stepmom sells it. I canâ€™t afford to pay an attorney up front. I can probably pay a filing fee for court but I donâ€™t know what to file since Iâ€™m only an heir and his wife wonâ€™t agree to me being executor and she doesnâ€™t even want an estate opened. My Grammys attorney is the one who said open an estate so the check when her house sells can go to my dads estate. I have daddyâ€™s death certificate and pictures of the shop, tools, vehicles, trailer, tag receipts, and  video proof of contents of shop and home as of his death just in case things disappeared. I donâ€™t think my stepmom would get rid of anything. Iâ€™m her only heir.

      "Generally, a developer of a new neighborhood can incorporate a homeowners' association (HOA) and subject all of the lots to mandatory membership before the lots are sold. If there are lots that were sold before the HOA was created, the developer has to obtain the homeownersâ€™ consent if their property was not subject to a HOA when they acquired their homes. In your situation, you purchased the property before there was an HOA and you are correct that you cannot now be forced to join the HOA, but you could voluntarily agree to be part of the HOA.Make sure that there was not a HOA agreement when you purchased the property.

Your only option at this point in time in order to sell the property is to bring a quiet title action to get your mother's name removed from the deed.

      "There is a legal process called asset forfeiture through which the government can take property that allegedly are the proceeds or instruments of a crime. You state that your uncle was arrested and charged for a drug crime. The question is, what happened next? For the government to take ownership of your uncle's land under this legal process, there would have to be a lawsuit. I suggest you start by going to the property office in the county where the property is located and obtain the property records for the property. If there was a lawsuit and a judicial deed conveying the property to the government, that deed would be filed with the property office.You can also check on Alacourt for a lawsuit against your uncle's estate. This would be required to take ownership of the property. You cannot access these records, but an attorney can. You could also go to the court clerk for the court where the property is located and ask them to look up any court cases against your uncle's estate. If you obtain the records in the case, you could see if the proper parties were notified. It may be that the proper parties were notified; you may not be that party.Once you obtain these two sets of records (if they exist) you will have a much better idea about your rights in this situation.\n"

      "The Uniformed Services Employment and Reemployment Rights Act (###), ### ###, sections ### - ###35, is a federal law that applies to all employers in all states. ### covers employees who serve in the U.S. uniformed services and guarantees an employee returning from military service or training the right to be reemployed at his or her former job (or as nearly comparable a job as possible) with the same benefits. The law requires employees to provide their employers with advance notice of military service, with some exceptions. You provided notice to your employer. You provided adequate.notice to your employer.The deadline for applying for reinstatement depends on how long the employeeâ€™s military service was. Here are the time limits:###: on the next scheduled ###, after safe travel home and an ### rest period### ###: within ###, and###: within ###.Of course, those timeframes do not involve the lay off situation you were in. If the employee is on layoff and begins service in the uniformed services, or is laid off while performing service, he or she may be entitled to reemployment on return if the employer would have recalled the employee to employment during the period of service. Therefore, you have a good argument for reemployment. You have the burden of proving that a status or activity protected by ### was one of the reasons that the employer took action against him or her, in order to establish that the action was discrimination or retaliation in violation of ###. If the individual succeeds in proving that the status or activity protected by ### was one of the reasons the employer took action against him or her, the employer has the burden to prove the affirmative defense that it would have taken the action anyway.Employers may not retaliate against military employees who exercise their rights under ###, including taking time off, applying for reinstatement, filing a complaint for an ### violation, or participating in a related investigation.Once your former employer is informed about ###, they may decide to voluntarily reinstate you as an employee. However, it may be best if you consult with an attorney prior to communication with your former employer so that you have a strategy in the likely event that they do not voluntarily reinstate you. I recommend that you reach out to one of the Volunteer Lawyers Programs at https://www.alabar.org/for-the-public/get-legal-help/ or look into legal assistance for service members, a couple of which are listed below.ABA Home Front www.abahomefront.orgProovides legal information, resources, and a directory of legal programs for veterans, service members, and military families.

      "I think this will be difficult for you to do on your own, but with an attorney you would have a good chance of getting custody of your niece. If everyone is on board, i.e. your sister and the grandmother, it would be a relatively simple thing to get custody. But if they are not on board, I recommend that you get an attorney. You would have to petition the court for custody, showing that it is in the best interests of the child for you to have custody. It sounds like you have a good case for that, but your best chance would be petitioning with an attorney. If you cannot afford one, you should check with the ### State Bar Volunteer Lawyer Program to see if they can help. Keep in mind that if her custodian does take her to Texas, and she establishes residency there, you would have to bring a petition for custody in Texas.\n",
      "Ok my kids mother allegedly failed a drug test at her doctor. Dhr was called. We are separated and live in different households.  Our kids live with me. She passed the drug screening for Dhr. Ok since I have the kids does it make it my case. The first lady came for a well visit and to make sure the kids lived with me. She acted like everything was fine.  That the case should be closed the kids was with me so all good. A new lady calls n I let come by. She is acting like the case is on me. My mom was with the kids at that time I was at work. Then the lady calls me back and is like I need to see you this time for my monthly visit.  Also talking about me filling out a safety plan. So I dont understand how this falls on me. I dont have any allegations against me. There mother really don't neither.  We dont live in the same home haven't been together in year's.  Can you please help me understand this. I would be extremely grateful for your time and knowledge.  I really don't know what to do are say. It feels like what she's doing ant necessarily right. But I not noing the law I feel like she's using that to her advantage. Even if it was against me . I still cant see how a failed drug test at a doctor can justify what is going on. \n",
      "DHR must follow chapter 660-5-###. When complaints are received, DHR has the responsibility to evaluate the situation and determine whether the children are being harmed or are at risk. You have the right to be informed by DHR of exactly what the allegations are. Make sure that there are no allegations against you, which there should not be from what you have indicated. You also have due process rights. DHR assesses whether children are safe and to intervene when they are not. Children are considered safe when there are no present or impending danger threats or the parentâ€™s/caregiverâ€™s protective capacities control existing threats. Children are unsafe when they are vulnerable to present or impending danger threats and parents/caregivers are unable or unwilling to provide protection. Safety plans are based on ### safety threats and are designed to protect chidren from those threats. Safety plans must use the least restrictive alternative. One alternative is an in-home safety plan. You should be informed about what the ### safety threats to the children are and what actions are proposed to be in the plan. You could voluntarily enter into a safety plan but you would have to acknowledge that a situation exists that needs to be remedied. If you do not agree to voluntarily enter into a safety plan when DHR's preliminary investigation indicates one is needed, then you need to be prepared that DHR may petition the court to secure adequate protection, care, and treatment for children - which may mean temporary removal of the children until a hearing can be held.It would be a good idea for you to consult with an attorney before you talk with DHR about the safety plan in case you do not agree to voluntarily enter into it.

      "Hello, thank you for your question. I would like a little bit more information about the particular settlement. Do you know if this settlement is a part of a class action lawsuit? Depending on the amount of the settlement you receive, that will be extremely helpful in assessing the type and amount of legal services you may need going forward. There are a variety of considerations, including federal and state tax laws, and potential wills/trust mechanisms that might be appropriate to help protect such a sum of money. An attorney would be able to advise you on these matters. You could also consider hiring a financial adviser or CPA (accountant).

      "I can certainly understand your concern for the health of your child and family because of COVID-19. Under the law, however, each parent is presumed to be fit and to make the health of their children a top priority.In general, it  is good practice to follow your custody and visitation order. If you have evidence that the other parent or a household member is actually infected with COVID-19, you could proceed with an emergency petition to request that the visitation order be changed.  Otherwise, it is very difficult to justify not allowing visitation or curtailing it due to the possibility of being infected by COVID-19.  You could communicate with your ex to see if you could reach a mutual temporary visitation agreement with some actions that can be taken to reduce the risk of infection from COVID-19.Keep in mind that parents with minor children are expected to adhere to Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (###) guidelines and to obey the proclamations issued by federal, state and local government officials that are intended to slow the transmission of COVID-19. The failure of a parent to follow those guidelines and government directives may be used as evidence that a parent is placing the health of a minor child at risk and could be used as a reason to petition the court to modify visitation temporarily.If you need legal help but cannot effood it, consider the following resources:###'s free legal information resources### Legal Help is ###'s free legal information website.Another great resource is ### ATJ, a project of the ### Access to Justice Commission.Legal aid programs in ###They give free legal help.

      "Mr. ###, I am sorry to hear about this circumstance for you.  My thoughts for you are this - you indicated the will had been probated.  If it was probated and the executors of the estate are not following the terms of the will, you need to go to the probate court where the will was probated.  When probated, beneficiaries are supposed to be served with notice about matters occurring in the probate court and are supposed to be informed of distributions.  So, I would start with going to the probate court for the county where it was probated (probably the county where they lived when they died).  If the real property (the realty) should have gone to you and others under the terms of the will, but the executors didn't do what they should have, then the probate court needs to unravel that.  I wouldn't advise you to go onto the property itself though.  You need the court to declare that you have some right to the property.  I wouldn't go assert yourself without first doing that.  Best to you in resolving this.  If you do go to probate court, you probably want legal counsel to help you there, and you should go to the ### State Bar Volunteer Lawyers Program to get counsel to assist you with that.\n",
      "Hi ###, thank you for your question. It is ###ways best to create a will, rather than leaving everything undecided. If you do not have a will when you pass, the state will divide out your assets (property, person### items, etc.) to those of your immediate family members who are living, based on intestate succession. For a brief overview of what this means, this website provides a brief overview of what will happen if you pass away without a will: https://estate.findlaw.com/planning-an-estate/understanding-intestacy-if-you-die-without-an-estate-plan.html#:~:text=When%20a%20person%20dies%20without,this%20kind%20on%20the%20books. That being said, it is ###ways best to create a will. When you create a will, you will be able to specify who gets what, and even exclude your son from receiving anything, if that is what you wish. By drafting a will, you can ###so specify whether you want your property and assets to go to a charity, church, organization, etc. As you can tell, there are many benefits to having a will, as it is the safest way to ensure that your wishes are followed after you pass away.There are sever### websites that can help you create a will online; however, there are ###so leg### aid organizations across the state that offer free clinics and can help draft a will for you.

      "Condolences on the death of your mom. It is good you reached out to get information about how to handle your mom's estate. First of all, you need to know how the homes, vehicles and bank accounts were titled - were they just in her name or were they co-owned? You can start by checking the home titles which information is available to the public. If any were co-owned, they pass to the co-owner directly. If they were owned by you mom only and any of the assets are located in ###, then you need to petition the Probate Court with jurisdiction to open her estate and ask that you be appointed personal representative of the estate. If your mom did not have a will, then the estate will be handled through intestatacy rules by the Probate Court. It will be important to list all of the estate property your mom owned at the time of her death. If your mom's boyfriend is in possession of any of those items, you will need to indicate that in the asset inventory. The bank accounts your mom owned herself will be addressed as part of the estate. Legitimate debts can be paid with the funds in the account and closed. Once the legitimate debts against the estate are paid, such as funeral and burial expenses, the court will approve distribution of the estate to the heirs. During probate, the personal representative can notify the three nationwide credit bureaus â€“ Equifax, Experian and TransUnion â€“ of your mom's death. The credit bureaus will seal her credit reports indicating that she is deceased. You will likely have to take legal action against your mom's boyfriend if he refuses to surrender property inherited by your mom's heirs. You have alleged that he had forged title documents - this will need to be addressed in court. Also, don't be surprised if your mom's boyfriend tries to claim that your mom owned him money that should be repaid by the estate - this type of claim must be proven in court by the boyfriend. While a person can probate and estate of a parent without a lawyer, the situation you described is more complicated and it is likely you will need a lawyer to represent your interest in the estate.

      "Hello, thank you for your question. I would first and foremost notify the app administrator (the company who owns the free texting app) that someone is using your identity without your permission and request that they immediate suspend and lock the account so no further activity can take place.

      "Mr. Severie,Because the case is pending in New York, you should get advice from an attorney in New York.That said, the New York courts provide some good information for pro bono parties which indicates that in the state of New York, it is not permissible to serve a summons on a party solely by mail.  That plus the fact that it was mailed to an address where you no longer reside makes it likely a court would not consider you to have been made a proper party to the case.Here is a helpful link from the New York courts which explains what constitutes bad service.http://nycourts.gov/Courthelp/GoingToCourt/badService.shtmlIf you have not been properly served, you are not yet part of the case. If a judgment is entered against you for not appearing, you could ask a court to set the judgment aside based on improper service.A separate issue is whether the New York courts have any basis for exercising jurisdiction over you.  You need to have some connection to the state for you to be brought into court in New York. From what you have relayed, there is not an immediate obvious basis for that jurisdiction.  You currently live in ### and just moved from ###.  That is not the entire analysis, however. If you have some involvement in the transactions at the center of the case, a court could find that you have had sufficient ties to New York to bring you into the lawsuit.I would urge caution about voluntarily getting involved in the case until you know whether the court has any jurisdiction over you. If you respond to the complaint, the court could find that you have agreed to let it make you part of a lawsuit that it otherwise may not have been able to involve you in.I hope this helps.### Horwitz\n",

      "Dear Mr. Sevrie, I spent some time this weekend looking at the status of the case against you in New York and doing some research into New York law. The latest development in the case is that the law firm representing the nursing home has taken steps to prove to the court that it has served your sister with the complaint.  Before the case can move forward, the law firm needs to show that it has followed the law and properly served the parties it is suing. The issue of proper service is an important one and that is why I asked if you had signed anything acknowledging that you received the complaint from the law firm.  If the law firm does not serve you exactly in the manner required under New York law, you are not required to participate in the case.  This means without proper service, it cannot proceed against you and eventually the court likely will dismiss you from the case.   I would be surprised if the law firm tries to jump through the required hoops to serve you with the complaint because even if it were able to serve you, it would run into a second problem: because you do not live in New York or have any recent obvious ties to New York, there is a strong argument that the court does not have jurisdiction over you.  It cannot enter a judgment against someone who does not have ties to the state. With two significant problems facing the law firm  â€“ trying to serve you when you live outside of New York and the court not having jurisdiction over you â€“ and a relatively small amount of money at stake (compared to what your sister is facing), I expect it is not going to be worth the law firmâ€™s time and energy to try to pursue you. At this point, since you have not been properly served, I would recommend that we wait and continue to watch the docket for any developments that would indicate the law firm is trying to argue that you have been served or that you have agreed to be part of the case.  If the law firm does not make those arguments, the court should dismiss you from the case without you needing to do anything. If we see any indication that the law firm is going to try to involve you in the case, we can then respond with a court filing laying out the arguments that you have not been served and/or that the court does not have jurisdiction over you since you have no current or recent ties to New York. It is very important that you not take any action in the case or agree to anything without first letting me know.  While you have strong arguments right now that the court cannot proceed against you, the wrong step could waive those arguments and make it much more difficult for you to get out of the case. I hope this helps. Please let me know if you become aware of any developments in the case or if you have any questions. All my best, ### Horwitz  \n",
      "Good Afternoon ###, Thank you again for keeping an eye on it. that is interesting tidbit. This make me wonder if the nursing home has come to realized two things. ###) me being out of state they may-not be able to get a judgement against me. and my sister may not have enough resources to cover it it would just cost them more money and no positive result from them. and or ###) due to the state hearing with Medicaid they are waiting for the result from that meeting with my sister to determined if the cost of a trial would be worth it. as far as i know from my sister she has not yet had her meeting. ### \n",
      "I think those are good theories.  One thing for you to think about is whether at some point you might want to ask a judge to hear it and dismiss the case against you. It's a fine line to walk because by appearing they might make an argument that the court then has jurisdiction over you, but there usually is a process where you can specially appear\" just for the purpose of challenging the court's jurisdiction. Whether you want to consider that or not comes down to how comfortable you are with this hanging out there indefinitely.###\"\n",
      "It's certainly not something that needs to be done any time soon. I was just looking ahead and wondering to what extent you will be comfortable having this case hanging out there indefinitely (and the answer may be that you're fine with it) or whether at some point you'd rather force the issue and (hopefully) get the court to dismiss it so it goes away permanently.Again, I think waiting and seeing what (if anything) the nursing home does makes perfect sense right now, so the issue of what to do if it doesn't do anything is one that we don't need to resolve right now. \n",

      "This is a risk that you take when you sign a lease with other people. I would have to see the lease to be sure, but my guess is that the lease makes all the tenants equally responsible for the entire lease. In this situation, each one of the tenants has a right to access the property. They also all have the duty to pay the rent. If you choose to prevent them from accessing the property by locking them out, changing the locks, or something of that nature, they may call the police to help get them back inside. I never know what the police will do in this situation. There is a good chance they won't get involved, but there is also a chance that they will tell you that you have to let the other tenants into the house.In summary, there is no good answer to this issue. You could ask your landlord if they will terminate the lease and sign a new one, but they may not be willing to do that unless all the tenants on the lease agree to sign the lease termination.\n",

A copy of results should be sufficient to provide the employer notice of an employee's results and safeguard the interests of other employees in the workplace.  Your husband should inquire as to why this information is being requested.  I am not familiar with community correction centers and their disclosure policies and practices. However, if your husband's employer is requesting said information in the interests of protecting the safety of other co-workers and inmates, then I think your husband should strongly consider disclosing said information.  In any event, I think it is wise of your husband to consider the fact that this is a novel area developing every day and should do his best to comply with his employer's requests.

      ". I am not simply seeking to erase the father listed on birth certificate or to chase him for child support. I only want to change my sons legal last name before he starts school. Father listed on birth certificate has been ###  for ###. I simply want my young son to have my last name, the last name of the primary male role model in his life which is my father. Not only does the father listed not have anything to do with my son, none of his family does either so his last name leaves him simply feeling different from the family that he is with constantly. There are no other millwoods in his life, he is for all intents and purposes a ###, and he is surrounded with them. Not that it is important but ### is also easier for a ###. He would have the same last name as his grandfather, great grandfather, uncles and cousins nearby, and his mommy. I will seek terminate his father's rights if he never responds later on but I am focused on just the name change before he starts school next year.\n",
      "Regardless of father's involvment or not, you would have to get the father to sign the petition for change of last name.  Easiest way to do is to file for child support which he would owe and be responsible for payment of; and with a judgment there he may be willing to voluntarily sign the papers for a legal name change without going through the effort of terminating parental rights....which a court frowns upon for various other reasons.  Is he list as father on birth certificate?   If so, should he die, your son would be entitled to social security benefits and if there was an estate, he would be entitled to inheritance from that estate.  So, here it gets complicated.  To me, the best route would be that ;you talk to the father and ask him if he will sign the papers and tell him you will not pursue child support if he will do so.\n",

Write as nice of a letter that you can write without threatening him about the child support, and ask him to please sign.  He may not be aware, but you can get a child support judgment against him and DHR will assist you in this.  Then you or DHR can go after any state income tax refund and they also have the resources to go after monthly payments from him from his employers.  So you have a very heavy hand that you can use with DHR to get him to sign.

      "Mr. ###,The Department of Human Resources was able to put a lien on your savings account because the back child support owed has likely been reduced to a judgment.  When there is a judgment it can be executed against savings/checking accounts, income tax refunds, real property (that is not a necessity for life), vehicles, wages and other property or assets.  Although you are current on your current obligation it does not eliminate the back time child support that you owe.  If your income has changed you can always file a petition to modify with the court.  Please keep in mind that with a modification it will only change the amount of your current support.  When establishing the amount of child support the Court looks at your ability to earn.  Therefore, you can not voluntarily take a job earning less just to pay less in child support.  Likewise, you are not entitled to social security disability if you are ### employed.  Also, you would need medical documentation to show that you are unable to work and your physical limitations prevent you from being able to do so.  Keep in mind social security disability can be an extremely difficult process. If there is a judgment on back support in the amount of $37,000.###.  In rare cases some people are able to reach a settlement by paying a lump sum of monies in satisfaction of the judgment.  \n"

      "Greetings,If language does not exist in the lease that states the security deposit will be forfeited, then to answer your question, the ### Code does not dictate whether a security deposit shall be forfeited in instances such as yours.I hope that helps. Best of luck!\n",
      "Yes.  I would recommend that a next-of-kin file a Petition for Letters Administration in the probate court in which the decedent resided at the time of his death.  The decedent's estate assets will be distributed according to the intestacy laws of ###.  I would advise consulting an attorney if possible.  Administering an estate in probate court can get complex depending on the circumstances. Furthermore, procedural laws must be followed and a lot of times an attorney's advice is needed to comply with the law and file the appropriate documents in probate court, etc. If you would like more detailed information regarding this process please reply and I will answer any questions or concerns.  I have a fair amount of experience this area of law. Regards and best wishes.\n",
      "I have been divorced since ###. In the divorce decree it says I have to give him my physical address if I move and need his signed agreement to move out of state. I graduated in Dec with a bachelors in Electrical engineering and cannot find work in ### but have multiple opportunities especially in Ca and Co. I currently have a case for child support with the state of ### because he didnâ€™t pay the first four years and is irregular in paying currently. Also he is supposed to have supervised visitation ever Saturday but hasnâ€™t contacted to see the kids since ###20. I donâ€™t know if he has a job or if he is homeless again or even if he is back on meth. I do not feel comfortable asking him if I see him because he may get physical, or worse, disappear again. What is my best course of action in being able to move? Is it possible to get him to sign over any parental rights if I waive the 20,###? Any help would be greatly appreciated!! \n",
      "Yes, you are still responsible for payment of child support.  Even if your rights have been terminated you have an obligation to provide for the financial needs of your children and child support continues.  Your obligation to pay child support will only end if your children are adopted.  If adopted then you no longer have any rights or obligations as another individual steps into your place and becomes responsible for all of the needs of your children.  \n",
      "My husband and I went to a mediator to talk, I thought, about our issues. I was told by the mediator that I didn't need an attorney at that time. But I also didn't know, until I  got there, that if we couldn't reconcile, that she was gonna go ahead and start the divorce process. I had a list of things that I wanted from him and one of those were half or a portion of his pension. The mediator/attorney said she checked with his employer and they didn't have spousal awarded pension. So it was not put in the decree. That bothered me and I didn't think it was true so I called the lady over the pension dept for the City of Birmingham. After trying to reach her, on several occasions, she said that they do have it, as long as it's put in the divorce decree, I  could receive it. I was married ###.

      "Hello,I would like to legally separate from my husband. I have not started the process yet. My question to you is what steps would I need to take to legally take my ###? Out of my ###, only the two youngest are biologically his. I currently live in ### where my children were born but I am from Michigan. Michigan is where my family/support system lives and I would like to go back there. I would not be able to afford to live on my own here because the whole time we have been married I have been a full time mom and part time worker due to lack of funds to cover child care. Iâ€™ve tried to work out a co-parenting schedule with my husband and we can not come to an agreement because he wants me to leave my only son who is ###. I do not want to leave my son because I am afraid it will be traumatic for him with his mother and sisters moving away giving the fact that we are really close. I do not want to separate my kids or leave my son with him when he works a full time job and the hours are long. He wouldnâ€™t have time to be there the way that I have always been there for my children. I have been wanting to move back to Michigan for years now and I could never convince him to do it. I really wish we could all move as a family but my husband and I have totally different views about things and we canâ€™t agree on anything. Neither of us have been happy for a long time and it is getting to the point now where we only speak when necessary because when we try to talk it turns into an argument. I no longer wish to share the same household with him because it has caused me a great deal of stress and anxiety. What should I do?\n",

      "Before you decide on whether you want to agree to a waiver, get a copy of your father's will by contacting the probate court and asking for a copy. You can then confirm your father's bequests. Generally, the people entitled to notice of the probate hearing are those who would benefit if the will was not admitted to probate, i.e., the surviving spouse and next of kin. If waivers are not obtained from all concerned, then the probate court must conduct a hearing to prove the will. In addition to admitting the will to probate, the court will appoint a personal representative to administer the estate. If all heirs want to waive notice of the hearing and will consent to admission of the will and the appointment of a particular person as personal representative, then the initial probate process is streamlined. If you want to make assertions about he validity of the will, you will need to do so right away. Also, if you have good reason why a person should not be appointed as personal representative, you can also contest that. \n",
      "Unless I read this incorrectly, it appears you were married for ###. Therefore, child was conceived while you were married and under ### law..... Your husband is the legal father. With this in mind you need to go back to court that issued visitation and challenge the original award of visitation. \n",
      "Mr. ###:Thank you for all the background on your matter. With that, I feel like I understand the circumstances well enough to give you some guidance. This is a fairly technical question on the topic of ### Civil Procedure, so please bear with me.Your questions are:Can you dismiss your counterclaim and reserve a right to file a separate action at a later time, if dismissed â€œwith prejudiceâ€?What are the probabilities of your prevailing on that claim, or not (and, incidentally, what is the proper cause of action to allege)? As to the first question: If you dismiss your counterclaim you may run the risk of the court later dismissing it on the defendantâ€™s Motion on the grounds this was/is a Compulsory Counterclaim, which would need to have asserted in response to the original suit.Compulsory Counterclaims are covered under the ### Rules of Civil Procedure, Rule ######(a), which states:A pleading shall state as a counterclaim any claim which at the time of serving the pleading the pleader has against any opposing party, if it arises out of the transaction or occurrence that is the subject matter of the opposing party's claim and does not require for its adjudication the presence of third parties of whom the court cannot acquire jurisdiction. But the pleader need not state the claim if: (###) at the time the action was commenced the claim was the subject of another pending action; or (###) the opposing party brought suit upon his claim by attachment or other process by which the court did not acquire jurisdiction to render a personal judgment on that claim, and the pleader is not stating any counterclaim under this Rule ######; or (###) the opposing party's claim is for damage covered by a liability insurance policy under which the insurer has the right or the obligation to conduct the defense. In the event an otherwise compulsory counterclaim is not asserted in reliance upon any exception stated in paragraph (a), relitigation of the claim may be barred by the doctrines of res judicata or collateral estoppel by judgment in the event certain issues are determined adversely to the party electing not to assert the claim. In raising this point I donâ€™t mean to say that I know that your counterclaim is compulsory, but only that this is a possibility. In other words, because your counterclaim likely does arise out of the transaction or occurrence made the basis of the plaintiffâ€™s original claim, it might be lost if you dismiss it and it does not fall under at least one of the three exceptions under Rule ######.The Rule also cautions that if there is an adjudication of the dispute that ### with the counterclaim allegations, even if the counterclaim is permitted as non-compulsory, the finding of the court in the prior proceedings will be binding. (This is in the reference to res judicata and collateral estoppelâ€¦a fancy way of saying, â€œWe already decided that, and weâ€™re not doing it all over again!â€)There is also one more exception to the need to make a compulsory counterclaim and that is if the amount sought to be recovered in that counterclaim is in excess of the jurisdictional limit of the District Court. The jurisdictional limit of any judgment by the District Court is $TERM00065###. If your case is alleged to be worth more than that, it would need to be filed in the Circuit Court, and that could not be alleged to have been a compulsory counterclaim.   Regarding the ### of dismissal with/without prejudice: If you agree to dismiss your counterclaim without prejudice (and it was not compulsory and without excepton ), you could file suit at any time before the Statute of Limitations expires. (The period of the Statute varies depending on the nature of the claim, but for our purposes ### consider it to be two years from the date you were served with the plaintiffâ€™s Complaint) Dismissal of the counterclaim â€œwith prejudiceâ€ means that it cannot be refiled at a later date. A voluntary dismissal of a claim or counterclaim is presumed to be â€œwithout prejudiceâ€, unless it specifically is stated otherwise.  As to the second question:  As far as Iâ€™m able to determine, â€œLack of Due Diligenceâ€ is not a valid and recognized cause of action in ###, at least not in the context of a debt collection matter. A challenge to that by the plaintiff could be pursued on those grounds, but the Rules are interpreted very broadly and the Court would probably allow you to amend the counterclaim to conform to the proof you offered at trial.Your allegations against the plaintiff seem to be more in the nature of a COA for Malicious Prosecution. Also, your claim may fall under the description of the ### Litigation Accountability Act, found in the ### Code, which provides: ######-###9-###7###. Court to award fees and costs against attorney or party who brought action without substantial justification; voluntary dismissal. (a) Except as otherwise provided in this article, in any civil action commenced or appealed in any court of record in this state, the court shall award, as part of its judgment and in addition to any other costs otherwise assessed, reasonable attorneys' fees and costs against any attorney or party, or both, who has brought a civil action, or asserted a claim therein, or ### a defense, that a court determines to be without substantial justification, either in whole or part;(b) When a court determines reasonable attorneys' fees or costs should be assessed it shall assess the payment thereof against the offending attorneys or parties, or both, and in its discretion may allocate among them, as it determines most just, and may assess the full amount or any portion thereof to any offending attorney or party;(c) The court shall assess attorneys' fees and costs against any party or attorney if the court, upon the motion of any party or on its own motion, finds that an attorney or party brought an action or any part thereof, or asserted any claim or defense therein, that is without substantial justification, or that the action or any part thereof, or any claim or defense therein, was ### for delay or harassment, or if it finds that an attorney or party unnecessarily expanded the proceedings by other improper conduct including but not limited to abuses of discovery procedures available under the ### Rules of Civil Procedure;(d) No attorneys' fees or costs shall be assessed if a voluntary dismissal is filed as to any action, claim or defense within ###, or during any reasonable extension granted by the court, for good cause shown, on motion filed prior to the expiration of said ###;(e) No party, except an attorney licensed to practice law in this state, who is appearing without an attorney shall be assessed attorneys' fees unless the court finds that the party clearly knew or reasonably should have known that his action, claim or defense or any part thereof was without substantial justification.  Note: If the provisions of paragraph (e) are proven, you may be entitled to recover attorneyâ€™s fees for defending the case, even without having a lawyer represent you.You may also choose to file a grievance with the ### Bar Association against the Attorney. This would not serve the purpose of recovering money damages, but would be an avenue to call the barâ€™s attention to the lawyerâ€™s conduct in pursuing the claim either with an intentional or reckless disregard for the true identity of the defendant before filing, or the exercise of reasonable diligence in asserting the true identity, and the failure to promptly investigate and dismiss the claim once the error was brought to his attention.  I would also advise you to consider if the matter falls under the requirements of the federal Fair Debt Collection Practices Act, and if that law provides federal jurisdiction in the matter. If it does, it may give you the ability to dismiss your counterclaim, file a separate action in the federal District Court, and provide for an exception to a compulsory counterclaim allegation. As I said, this is a fairly technical matter, but I hope that you find some value in this discussion and that it gives you some insight into your options. If you need to ask any follow-up questions, please do. If not, best of luck to you and best wishes for a satisfactory resolution of this dispute.    \n",
      "Glad to clear that up if I can. As I understand it, you were dismissed as a defendant on the plaintiff's claims only. Your counterclaim would survive until that time it is dismissed (either voluntarily or involuntarily). That is, you are essentially only a counter-claim plaintiff now. If I had to guess, I would predict the judge might go ahead and sever your claims and try them independently, if you are not inclined to dismiss them voluntarily.  A Motion would need be filed to sever the counterclaim, and try that independently. The court could do Order it severed on its own Motion.  Hope this makes sense. Civil procedure is not for the feint of heart! I would highly recommend that if you are serious about your counter-claim or a stand-alone action, you do look into getting representation soon. \n",
      "Glad I could help. As for ongoing or future questions that might arise, I would recommend you retain in-person representation by an ### licensed lawyer. This service canâ€™t replace that relationship, which benefits from more detailed communication in what is often a rapidly changing situation. Of course, if you have an follow-up questions on anything Iâ€™ve advised so far, I would be glad to do that if I can. \n",

Do you know if you had a lease to live in the shop? If not, there may be other options to recovery your items that were left behind; however, without a lease/rental agreement, there appears to be no legal right to remain there, which would explain why you did not receive an eviction notice.

After a few days apart they got back together but told my parents they had to get off the property in ###. Only after living in mobile home ###.

I was being nice even though they evicted my dying father & stressed mother - both in their ###.Today - nonstop text messages. She said I needed to come today & load her furniture.

      "Hello. Thank you for your question. I see this was submitted in ###; has the issue been resolved? If not, I have a few additional questions for you to make sure I understand the legal matters involved. When you purchased the camper, did you sign any type of agreement in writing? Did you receive a ### of sale or title to the camper when you purchased it? Generally, when purchasing a physical good, such as a camper, vehicle, etc., you obtain a ### of sale, or enter into a contract for the purchase of the item. If so, you can enforce that contract in court and seek to enforce the sale of the camper. If there was no signed agreement, depending on the circumstances, you may have entered into an oral contract, which may also be enforceable in a court of law. I will need some additional details regarding the purchase of the camper to advice on how to best enforce the sale of the camper. Any additional details you can provide would be greatly appreciated. Thank you. \n",
      "In ###, custody is determined by what is in the best interest of the child. In many cases even when parents have never been married, a court will say that joint custody is what is in the best interests. The court may look at various factors in making this determination, and either parent has grounds to request custody. \n",
      "Mr. ###: The first action would be to contact the individual who placed the lien on the property. You do not need a lawyer to contact that person on your behalf. The lien will have the information of the person who filed the lien. You should send a letter to that person demanding that the lien be removed immediately and explain how the lien is for a different person with a different address, and include all the differences that makes it clear it is not meant to for you. In the letter include that the lien holding up a loan modification. If the person refuses to remove the lien, you may have an action against that person for money damages. Best of luck.\n",

      "Hello Miss ###, It will be very difficult to determine whether you have a viable case without more information. A seasoned plaintiff's attorney would best be able to help you with that determination. I would recommend reaching out to some plaintiff's attorneys to see what they believe your odds of success are. Many don't charge a fee for an initial consultation, and many don't charge at all unless then win, in which case they will take a percentage of the award as payment. Please note your claim may be barred after ###, so I would recommend contacting plaintiff attorneys soon.I hope this helps!\n",
      "Hi Mr. ###,It will depend on what kind of case you lost at the circuit level. Not everything is appealable. However, there are specific rules that will be helpful. You can find the TERM00059### Rules of Appellate Procedure here:https://judicial.TERM00059###.gov/library/AppellateProcedureI recommend starting at Rules ###, ###, and ###. From there, you can review the other rules to see what kind of filing you need (i.e. petition for writ of ###, notice of appeal, etc.). Do this quickly, as your time to appeal can expire much faster than you would imagine (i.e. a ### petition really needs to be filed within ###). I have also found the clerk of the TERM00059### Supreme Court very helpful. I have not dealt with the clerk for the other appellate courts in TERM00059### (courts of civil and criminal appeals)  but if you are kind and polite they are generally the same way back. You will also need to confirm which court you are appealing to. Certain types of appeals have to go to specific courts, so make sure you are getting to the correct court. The rules of appellate procedure will be a very helpful starting point.  Hope this helps!\n",

      "Both parents have a legal right to their child. However, when the parents are not married the father must establish paternity. Absent your voluntary agreement, the father can do this by taking the child into his home and openly holding out the child as his natural child or otherwise openly holding out the child as his natural child and establishing a significant parental relationship with the child by providing emotional and financial support to the child. The father may also go through a more formal process of legitimization. Absent a court order you do not need to allow him visitation, but he does have the right the pursue it. In terms of a will, you will not be able to use that to prevent the father from having custody if you die. The overarching standard for custody in ### is the best interest standard. Decisions will be made based on what arrangement is in the best interest of the child.   \n",

      "Yes, you must report the amount of your personal injury settlement to Social Security timely. Be aware that if you do not make arrangements for the settlement money, your assets will be above the countable income and resources limit for SSI ($###,### $###,###) and it will adversely affect your SSI eligibility.I strongly recommend that you use your personal injury settlement and establish an irrevocable Special Needs Trust, also known as a Supplemental Needs Trust, for your sole benefit. A trust is a legal agreement between the grantor, the person creating and funding the trust; the beneficiary, the disabled person who will benefit from the trust disbursements; and the trustee, the person who manages the trust on behalf of the beneficiary. This type of Special Needs Trust must be irrevocable and must contain a pay-back provision Medicaid, The assets in a Special Needs Trust are not considered a countable asset in qualifying for government benefits. This type of trust ensures that the disabled person receives SSI, subsidized housing, and/or Medicaid benefits. While government benefits provide the basics for a special needs person, a Special Needs Trust can help maintain quality of life and provide for needs other than food, shelter and clothing. A Special Needs Trust will name successor beneficiaries who will receive the assets upon the disabled personâ€™s death. See https://www.ssa.gov/ssi/spotlights/spot-trusts.htm. One place that offers such a trust is The ### Family Trust. see https://www.###familytrust.com. You can also talk to your bank about setting up a trust. You can report the settlement check to Social Security after you establish a Special Needs Trust.In addition, I would strongly recommnend that you establish a separate bank account for your SSI so that there is no co-mingling of the settlement money with the SSI. Use this account for direct deposit of SSI income only.\n",

      "Hi ###,First--when did you originally file the case? Your statute of limitations for a fraud claim is two years. So, you have to file again by two years after you discovered the fraud. Because the case was dismissed for lack of prosecution, it may have been dismissed without  prejudice, meaning you might be able to file it again. You will not be able to file a new case directly with the ### Circuit. That is an appellate court, meaning it only hears appeals of decisions in other cases. You could attempt to appeal the dismissal, but that will be an uphill battle. If your first case was dismissed with prejudice, or  you are past the statute of limitations, that would be your next option. You'll want to refer to the Eleventh Circuit Local Rules and the Federal Rules of Appellate Procedure to confirm you are following the correct procedures. You could also consider engaging a plaintiff's attorney--many of them will work on a contingency basis, meaning they don't get paid unless you do, and they take a portion of the award or settlement. The ### Rickard firm in Birmingham has an excellent reputation, and I would recommend calling them. I hope this helps!\n",

It is our understanding from your questions that you wish to retain your father's property and continue making the mortgage payments.If that is correct, there are two issues here.###) Who is entitled claim your father's property now?  Who is on the deed to that property?  If there are other people on the deed, they have an interest in the property.Was your father married at the time of his death?  If so, his spouse has an interest in that property.Did your father have other children?  If so, they have an interest in that property.You have to establish who ###l has an ownership interest in your father's property.   You could resolve this by probating his estate in the county where he lived at the time of his death.  To do this, you would have to file with the probate court.  You may need a lawyer to assist with this, but you could t###k with the Probate Court first to see if this is something you can do by yourself.###) Can you assume the mortgage payments?  Most likely, the mortgage company is not going to let you assume the payments (and forego foreclosure) until they are sure you are the owner of the property. Even then, they are going to make sure you have the ability to repay the loan.  This means they are going to ask you for your assets, debts and income in order to decide whether or not they will ###low you to assume the loan.  Unfortunately, we can't tell you what they will decide, this is completely their decision.We would suggest that you ###so check with the county tax assessor/revenue department to determine if the property taxes have been paid.You could ###so consult Leg### Services of ### for further assistance.  They are located at ###, Suite ###00, ###, ### ### ###-###.Unfortunately, the transfer of property can be a very complicated process.   We wish you the best of luck.\n",

      "The answer to your question changes based on whether the court officially terminated your daughters parental rights OR whether the court only awarded the father full custody. If the termination of your daughter's parental rights started with a petition from DHR (Department of Human Resources) then you will be unable to petition for visitation rights.  However, if the father was awarded full custody but the court did not terminate custody, you may be able to petition for visitation.In order to be successful you would need to show that the visitation is in the best interest of the child, you have a significant and viable relationship with the child, and any of the following circumstances exist.(###) The child resided with the grandparent for at least six consecutive months within the three years preceding the filing of the petition.(###) The grandparent was the caregiver of the child on a regular basis for at least six consecutive months within the three years preceding the filing of the petition.(###) The grandparent provided significant financial support for the child for at least six consecutive months within the three years preceding the filing of the petition.(###) The grandparent had frequent or regular contact with the child for at least ###.Even with this being met, the father's decision on the matter will still be given weight. \n",

      "My ex-wife moved away, has been remarried for several years. The ex always made visitation almost impossible. A few years ago she cut off all communications with our daughter (she just turned 12).

My question is, if I agree to the adoption, can I negotiate for child support refund sum from time the ex cut off all communications with me and our daughter?The attorney said he would not have me served if I agreed to the adoption. In truth I am okay with the adoption as I had a great stepfather most of my life.
